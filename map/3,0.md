Empty, empty, empty. 
A path leading out from nothing.

The road continues. 
Someday, when someone walks [[with]] me,
I [[hope]] they might see the joy that once
flitted on [[my]] eye when at 3am
on the morning [[of]] a statutory holiday
I stayed up to watch videos about Renâ€™Py
instead [[of]] doing anything else [[with]] [[my]] [[time]].
