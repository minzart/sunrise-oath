Pirates, filled [[with]] greed for notions [[of]] gold, stop [[me]], the wavering hero. “Riches await,” [[they]] beckon. “Make this your final stay, and work [[with]] us.”

The answer was plain as day, perhaps. Yet I had still [[my]] pride, ambition, [[duty]]. “[[Know]] you [[of]] Icarus?” I ask. “The [[wings]] [[of]] Daedalus melt when comes the sun.”

The pirates laugh, heckle, jeer. “You, who killed your mother, [[have]] the gall to [[speak]] [[of]] myth?”

I seek calmness, [[silence]], balance—the mark [[of]] sages. “[[Truth]] stands as it [[is]].”
