I have been [[restless]] all [[this]] time. It [[feels]] as [[through]] a terrible thing will happen. I know that I shall prevail, yet [[the]] thrill [[of]] [[battle]] is preceded by the nerves and the shaking.

My sight is true. My aim? It shall be tested. I am seen, being watched by the snake and the father alike. A red flower, memento [[of]] a past council [[of]] wizards, gives me strength. Stricture [[of]] discipline and force [[of]] law command me.
