[[charlotte|Charlotte]] / [[louise|Louise]].

Irresistible [[grace]]. Divine, [[chaste]] eroticism. She knows [[all]], and acts [[not]]. She forgives, and delivers souls.

A goddess cannot let [[me]] [[touch]] [[her]]  [[hand]]. 

For those to seek to buy their way to [[power]], [[there]] is [[only]] [[pity]]. The [[matter]] of the [[world]] can never be [[one]] with the [[heart]]. It is forever a wayward steed, leading man galloping into eternal void. 

The [[heart]] is the [[sister]] of the spade, that inversion of the [[curator]]'s pure eternal love that the doctor saw as the lie that it was.

The allure of Christ is what [[redeemed]] her. The craft of her father is what made her, and destroyed her. [[3d]]
