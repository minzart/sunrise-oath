[[charlotte|Charlotte]] / [[louise|Louise]].

Irresistible [[grace]]. Divine, chaste eroticism. She knows [[all]], and acts [[not]]. She forgives, and delivers souls.

A goddess cannot let me [[touch]] [[her]]  [[hand]]. 

For those to seek to buy their way to [[power]], [[there]] is [[only]] [[pity]]. The matter of the [[world]] can never be one with the heart. It is forever a wayward steed, leading man galloping into eternal void.
