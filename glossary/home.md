A drunk man will find his way home, but a drunk bird may get lost forever. — Shizuo Kakutani 

Turn-based game (maybe ADV VN format). Board state is updated every turn. No true ending to the game, meant to be a place to go back to. Every turn, the player progresses the clock one hour. He befriends a bird in a cage, and eventually lets it out. It promises to come back, and from then on sporadic conversations with the bird are the main emotional thread.

< You live with a man and a bird. To pass the time, you write in a journal. > 

A story-rich journaling game about random walks and chance encounters. 

The man spends his days wandering around drunk. 
(Random walks on an array-simulated 2D plane.) 
When he is back, he has one-sided conversations with the player. 

The bird is in a cage, and tries to get the player to let it out.
Once released, it flies away and shows up from time to time, til one day it never comes back. 
(Random flight in an array-simulated 3D space.) 

There will be a last meeting between the player and the bird. They never know when it will be, or if it has been.
