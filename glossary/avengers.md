Incredibly, Lauren and I were friends [[again]] by the end of the school year. I [[got]] Sean to ask her out, and [[they]] dated for a while. [[One]] restless summer, [[thinking]] [[they]] [[broke]] up, I walked to her place twice and fooled around [[with]] her in the basement while her mom was [[gone]]. I knew not that she was back [[with]] Sean at the [[time]], [[finding]] out at the same [[time]] I heard she was cheating on him [[with]] Panagiotis, a Greek [[boy]] I played cards [[with]] at lunch. Sean [[never]] found out about [[my]] involvement, and confided that he was glad that Lauren [[got]] fat before [[graduation]]. I thought it was mean, and mourned the death of her attractive abdomen, but nodded as I was mad that [[Emily]] and Iscah knew the whole [[time]], helping her hide everything and defending her [[after]].
