Determined [[to]] [[find]] [[out]] [[more]], [[Elara]] [[sets]] [[out]] [[to]] investigate. [[She]] talks [[to]] [[the]] locals, trying [[to]] gather any [[information]] [[they]] might [[have]] [[about]] [[the]] lockdown.

[[She]] [[eventually]] learns [[that]] [[there]] [[have]] [[been]] reports [[of]] [[a]] dangerous [[bandit]] gang operating [[in]] [[the]] area. [[The]] commander [[of]] Lion's [[Keep]] [[has]] ordered [[the]] lockdown [[in]] [[an]] attempt to keep the citizens safe.

[[Elara]] decides to see if she can help. With her skills as a thief, she thinks she might be able to infiltrate the bandit gang and gather information that could help the [[guards]] track them down.

She spends the next few days observing the comings and goings of the gang, trying to find a way in. Finally, she spots an [[opportunity]] and sneaks into their hideout.
