I stayed sitting up that night. When Catherine (the Russian divorc√©e, not the former lover) came on her last check of the night, she came to my side and [[bid]] me to sleep. The tears [[flowed]] then, and I extended my arms to her like a needy child. Surely she had no duty to comply, nor would professional practice have recommended it, but she sat on the bed and ministered to my confused teenage heart.
