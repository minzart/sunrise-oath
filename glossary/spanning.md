[[Selene]] lived by five [[rules]], and [[agreed]] [[to]] teach [[me]] [[three]]. [[Rule]] [[One]]: Hunger once a [[day]]. This one was easy, or so I thought. “That includes cigarettes,” she [[insisted]]. “Spend your days in want.” And so I allowed myself to be deprived, til my mind stopped fighting it. A week passed, and I [[learned]] this first [[lesson]].

“The fog has lifted from my mind,” I reported.

“[[Congratulations]],” she said. “Time to [[bring]] it back.”
