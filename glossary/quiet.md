my fire my star [[my]] joy my sweet  
angel on a plum tree by the hill  
full and sweet yet empty and bitter  
  
frightened of the corner pizza store  
where mister [[vincenzo]] told us off  
for playing with our food too much  
  
white lily in the garden on the street  
where we reposed in wait for the bus  
and wondered what got into him  
  
everyone has a dark flame burning  
you said after our laughs were done  
the heart of man is endless void  
  
what do i say to bring her back  
the perfect girl I knew before  
who had no knowledge of sin  
  
or so i though for who could not  
the world was harsh and cruel  
wait why did i say that out loud  
  
she and i have joined together  
matrimony of the winter gloom  
after the flower we saw that day  
  
had died along with the [[leaves]]  
the [[branches]] and the fruit of life  
we ate on the day we fell in love.
