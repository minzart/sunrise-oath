[[Hortus]] makes Gale a masala chai for the first [[time]] on the day when he was tired.  
  
Sarah Carice's dream is to understand one thing, The [[Wind]] at Dawn, better than anyone else. Sarah Carice never liked her name, though she learns to appreciate it [[after]] her mother passes away and she spends [[time]] away from home. She learns from Selene and/or Ancra the connection between The [[Wind]] at Dawn and her name, or that someone is waiting for her in Montreal.  
  
Sarah Carice is [[Hortus]]'s half-[[sister]]! Alain got [[Hortus]]'s adoptive father (his own childhood friend) thrown in jail, and feels guilty. [[Hortus]] has no sexual feelings toward Sarah Carice, and loves her as a mother figure and spiritual ally.  
  
Alain loved Sylvie, but cheated on her with another woman. Sylvie forgave him and treated [[Hortus]] as her own.  
  
[[Hortus]]: "Alain is family, his daughter is my [[sister]], and I don't think of him as my father. Is something wrong with that?"  
  
[[Hortus]] is [[Abraham]], 'father' of Ishmael. Ishmael, Marie Eilish Jones, follows the patterns of her predecessors. The original Ishmael is saved from dying from thirst, Moby-Dick's Ishmael is saved from drowning, and Ishmael is saved by Marie Eilish from missing the sea and seasickness (on air and water).  
  
Ishmael is the "legitimate" child, who is sidelined in favor of Isaac. Isaac is offered as a [[sacrifice]].  
  
Isaac is Alacrity, who [[Hortus]] decides to [[sacrifice]] for the greater good. Jason thinks that Alacrity must be Ahab in the analogy, but Ahab is Gale Jones, her birth father and the 'brother' of her 'father'.  
  
Génoise et Thé (Waterloo) partly closes down because [[Hortus]] decides to go home to Montreal.  
  
Quinine Clement, the daughter of Aphrodite, is Aeneas and Cupid.
