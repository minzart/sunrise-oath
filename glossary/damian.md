You [[never]] stopped [[being]] [[my]] teacher. I [[never]] stopped [[being]] fourteen, wanting to [[show]] [[off]] a little to you. For [[all]] these [[years]] you [[have]] believed in [[me]] and counseled [[me]]. It was always of [[great]] artistic [[value]] to [[me]] to [[play]] [[with]] you and [[martisor|Martisor]]. I donâ€™t [[know]] [[if]] you [[know]] this (perhaps I [[told]] you?), but [[one]] of the unpublished [[works]] I toiled at [[most]] had a character based on you and your [[career]] at WCI. In you I see a [[fellow]] misfit, a [[companion]] in the [[path]] of the gadfly. Though [[all]] these [[years]], you [[have]] [[become]] [[an]] uncle to [[me]]. Perhaps this [[is]] [[an]] understatement, for I [[have]] not spared more [[than]] a passing [[thought]] to a single person [[my]] [[parents]] once had [[me]] [[call]] "uncle", not [[even]] the blood relatives who [[took]] [[me]] in [[their]] homes for two summers. Meanwhile, I [[find]] myself [[eager]] for the next [[time]] I [[am]] summoned to your [[magnificent]] [[court]] on Redfox for [[another]] upcoming performance. [[Maybe]] [[we]] [[could]] arrange to [[meet]] more often, [[maybe]] once a [[month]], for some exchanges of stories and art. I [[feel]] like [[we]] both belong to the parlor life of [[an]] [[older]] [[time]], [[so]] [[maybe]] a [[social]] project [[along]] those lines [[could]] be fun. ([[Also]], I [[have]] yet to [[introduce]] [[my]] [[second]] piano to you!)
