[[Splotch]] [[of]] [[red]] [[on]] a canvas, straddling the horizon
Stretching left to right within the wood frame
(Ebony, from a tree grown by the museum)
Taking up its space and staying in its proper place
Asking nothing of the viewer except that they know
The life of the farmer and his second wife, who brought
A son from her teenage pregnancy (consensual but barely)
Handsome and sturdy, a perfect pair of arms and legs
That hop the fence and wrangle with the cattle
With not a trace of hardship on his smooth brow.

Abstract art is poorly understood.
