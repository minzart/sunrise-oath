Mundane Tragedy

Dante made Beatrice to save himself when he was older if he lost [[hope]].

Inferno - 
Purgatorio - Beatrice [[is]] an AI made by Dante.
Paradiso - Dante finds out he [[is]] an AI made by Beatrice, and that he passes the [[test]].

Dante acts like a worshipping fanboy. At the end, he finds out he [[is]] only this way because she made him like that. Beatrice wants to be a girl in an otome [[game]].
