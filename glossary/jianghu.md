SELENE
[[There]] is the [[path]] of valley and peak. Find the way of river and lake.  

GALE
River and lake?  

SELENE
As shores recede, the oceans [[shall]] advance. All that you [[thought]] not [[possible]] is a [[matter]] of perspective. See it from the [[other]] side: the [[globe]] is mostly [[water]]. Do you swim?  

GALE
No.  

SELENE
Neither do I. But [[good]] analogy, right?
