I still have moments of walking in darkness, straying from the light (in mind more than in action, though the latter too) as a sort of fun entertainment. Fair game, far as I am concerned; when one knows clearly where is home, then wandering out to the slums or the [[wilderness]] (what difference is there, on the worst of days?) is simply one more way of reaching God, of seeing what all creation is trying to tell us.
