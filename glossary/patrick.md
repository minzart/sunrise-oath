I [[shall]] not send this [[one]], for I [[fear]] putting [[pressure]] on you to [[read]] a [[long]] block of [[text]]. The greatest [[fear]] [[is]] [[never]] that you [[will]] ignore [[me]], but that you [[will]] pay too [[much]] attention. For [[many]] [[years]] I [[have]] [[thought]] of [[what]] it [[means]] to love your family and to protect [[someone]]. [[When]] [[we]] [[were]] [[younger]], the failures of [[my]] inexperience [[were]] plain to see. [[Now]], I [[find]] myself [[learning]] [[from]] you [[how]] to care for [[others]] and prevent resentment. As you [[know]], I oscillate [[between]] wanting to spend a lot of [[time]] and [[being]] holed [[up]] in [[my]] room [[with]] [[my]] latest [[deep]] dive. Recently, esp. given the developments in [[our]] family, I [[have]] [[seen]] the irreplaceable [[value]] of regular and reserved communion. You [[are]] [[much]] more mature [[than]] [[me]] in this regard. In you, I see the [[good]] of [[everyone]] [[else]] in [[our]] family, and the [[struggles]] [[we]] [[all]] surely [[face]]. [[Maybe]] you [[are]] the [[best]] archetype of [[what]] it [[means]] to be "[[one]] of [[us]]".
