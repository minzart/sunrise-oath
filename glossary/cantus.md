in the same dream I saw on a restless night  
speaking through the cloudy ether void  
the midnight hare elated at the foam  
coating the end of a curious fingertip  
  
no better had i felt the root of roots  
than when she took me on a pocket walk  
through places she reserved for [[solitude]]  
on bright green mornings ere the midday wash  
  
to see with my own very eyes above  
the floating miracle before the meal  
a [[thought]] came far too soon and stayed in me  
behold the beauty of the afternoon
