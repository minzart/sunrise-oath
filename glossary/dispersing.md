[[In]] [[the]] [[end]], [[I]] [[found]] her [[not]]. But [[I]] saw her one more time that evening. Back in October 1989, I was a fourteen-year-[[old]] boy not yet exposed to Playboy or adult films, and knew not the wonders of the naked female form. I was too sheltered to conceive of what was under Taraâ€™s uniform, the garments that clung to her [[alluring]] body. Picturing her as I touched myself, what I saw was her smile, her laugh, the way she said my name.
