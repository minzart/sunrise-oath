[[Dreams]] — [[there]] are two types of [[dreams]]. I dream of the wind and the sun, of Gale [[Jones]] and Dawn.

I present a [[story]] about [[dreams]]. This account is not a [[hypothetical]], a fiction in the lines and spaces. I [[assert]] this as fact, though the lawyer and the engineer object: everything I say is true, or as [[good]] as true.
