  
[[From]] [[my]] own [[conversations]] [[with]] Muslims, [[the]] underlying [[understanding]] [[of]] [[salvation]] [[is]] perfectly compatible with Christianity, minus the necessity of the death on the [[cross]]. If I were a Muslim, I would say that if God can incarnate to die as fulfillment of his wrath, he can also fulfill it either by saying so or by other demonstrations. The fundamental theme is grace, and Jesus's death was a demonstration of grace.
