By then, I had [[new]] friends, two girls that met at [[seven]] in the morning to [[read]] and chat at [[Coffee]] [[Culture]] near the Boardwalk. Linda’s small house was near the Chinese [[church]], and Catherine’s manor was in a pricey neighborhood. Their houses were near everything [[new]] [[being]] built, [[something]] I envied as [[someone]] who had [[only]] a small plaza near home. Chasing the exciting life I [[thought]] [[they]] had, I relished their company. Over [[time]], [[we]] grew [[close]].
