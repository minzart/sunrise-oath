[[We]] [[spoke]] just [[yesterday]], and the [[games]] [[we]] played [[are]] on [[my]] mind. I always enjoyed playing [[games]] [[with]] you, for money or otherwise, and speaking about strategy or coming [[up]] [[with]] [[new]] ideas for gaining the newest [[edge]]. I was [[glad]] to [[show]] you *[[Duality]]* [[yesterday]], and perhaps due to the cerebral [[nature]] of the [[game]] it [[felt]] like the [[old]] days of playing heads [[up]] at your kitchen [[table]]. [[Maybe]] [[one]] [[day]] [[we]] [[can]] [[play]] [[another]] match, though for [[now]] I [[am]] [[still]] worried of [[being]] sucked back [[into]] the world of preflop charts and tense [[breathing]] behind a mask. But [[now]] and always, for the [[time]] [[we]] [[have]] [[together]], [[may]] [[we]] enjoy [[many]] [[ciders]].
