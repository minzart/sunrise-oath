My [[body]] tells [[me]] [[things]] I cannot [[say]] [[aloud]] in [[simple]] terms. The slight tightness of the jaw, the jitters in my stomach and feetâ€”[[wait]], I [[took]] a caffeine pill this [[morning]]. [[How]] [[could]] I [[forget]]? I made [[such]] a decision, and [[forgot]] about it til I [[started]] [[writing]]. This is the power of my mind, the ghost [[living]] in the [[machine]] [[far]] [[beyond]] my own comprehension.

My [[brain]] is the [[external]] [[world]]. I [[forget]], so I [[must]] repeat. [[History]] is a cycle of losing and [[finding]].

Listening to [[music]] [[helped]] to unlock the [[many]] [[things]] I [[took]] for granted. Example: I [[forgot]] except on [[paper]] the way that [[music]] is a literal [[language]], complete with grammar and [[culture]]. This was transparent to [[me]], as [[much]] as the accent of [[an]] American is a pane of glass.
