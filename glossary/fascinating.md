[[The]] stories [[that]] [[Magic]] [[tell]] [[more]] explicitly [[are]] [[also]] [[beautiful]] [[and]] interesting [[in]] [[their]] own [[right]] (this whole [[thing]] was sparked by [[me]] [[seeing]] Karn holding the [[head]] of Elesh Norn, the [[white]] Praetor and the representation of the forefront of a [[new]] emergent order of corrupt [[thought]]), but I think [[there]] are [[also]] the stories [[told]] [[through]] card [[design]] and the process of Magic evolving as a [[game]], which itself has a ton of [[selection]] pressures [[against]] it.
