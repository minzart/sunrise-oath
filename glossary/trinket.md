## [[I]] [[know]] [[her]] [[not]] [[and]] [[love]] [[her]] [[all]] [[the]] [[same]].

[[I]].  
  
[[I]] [[leave]] [[no]] [[fragments]] [[of]] [[the]] [[life]] forgone  
[[as]] [[I]] traverse the woodland afternoon â€”  
tree to tree, hour to hour, forever.  
  
Abandoned are the words I never said,  
the murmurs breathed with nary more than a whimper.  
  
On the bark of the trees I think to leave a mark,  
then say: "I spare you, friend. God made you too."  
  
II.  
  
A small bistro boutique atop a hill,  
oasis in the burst of wilderness.  
  
The soup and sandwich shall take twenty minutes  
(a movement of a Mahler symphony),  
too long to nurse a lemon Perrier.  
  
I drink instead the image of a woman,  
large glasses perching on an upturned nose,  
thin lips that purse before they softly speak,  
long fingers tapping on the register.  
  
III.  
  
She is an angel, I am sure of it.  
  
Am I allowed to bother her again,  
though I have nothing more to ask or order?  
  
I take my pen and visit her in here.
