1. Dirty blonde, long cardigan, plaid skirt, [[good]] [[Christian]] girl shoes, [[glasses]], no mask. Peeking over at [[me]] as I read Harper's Magazine.  
2. Brown hair, eyes so blue it hurts my soul, red nails, brown purse, [[white]] dots on jeans, [[black]] dots on sleeves of her small coat. Neurotic lady [[with]] accent, pretty like my mother.  
3. Blonde waist-length hair in angelfish tail, Pub on [[King]] uniform, severe eyes. Asked us [[with]] [[disdain]] if [[we]] wanted more drinks.  
4. [[Light]] brown hair, [[forgot]] her outfit because all I could look at were her eye-sparkles and her smile. Has to be a Marnie, a Jasmine, or a Rachel.

Gale has a dream of how his life could [[have]] went if he [[never]] saw Sarah Carice on the summer dinner cruise. He [[wakes]] up in the hospital.
