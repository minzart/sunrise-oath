1. Dirty blonde, long cardigan, plaid skirt, [[good]] [[Christian]] girl [[shoes]], [[glasses]], no mask. Peeking over at [[me]] as I [[read]] Harper's Magazine.  
2. Brown hair, eyes so blue it hurts my soul, red nails, brown purse, [[white]] dots on jeans, [[black]] dots on sleeves of her small coat. Neurotic lady [[with]] accent, pretty like my mother.  
3. Blonde waist-length hair in angelfish tail, Pub on [[King]] uniform, severe eyes. Asked us [[with]] [[disdain]] [[if]] [[we]] wanted more [[drinks]].  
4. [[Light]] brown hair, [[forgot]] her outfit because all I [[could]] look at were her [[eye]]-sparkles and her smile. Has to be a [[Marnie]], a Jasmine, or a Rachel.

Gale has a dream of [[how]] his life [[could]] [[have]] went [[if]] he [[never]] [[saw]] Sarah Carice on the summer dinner cruise. He [[wakes]] up in the hospital.
