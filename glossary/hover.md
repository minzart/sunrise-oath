[[What]] [[bliss]], to create [[with]] [[an]] [[open]] [[heart]] [[and]] expect [[that]] [[none]] of it [[shall]] [[ever]] [[be]] [[seen]]! Yet [[soon]] as I [[am]] aware of the [[audience]], the auditor of [[my]] [[soul]], I [[could]] no [[sooner]] [[drop]] [[dead]]. Such is how I felt til I was convinced of God, that I was always seen and could never hide.
