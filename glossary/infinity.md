[[Time]] passed. [[I]] cleaned [[my]] un et demi, fussing [[over]] details [[the]] [[curator]] fixed sooner and [[better]]. [[The]] studio [[apartment]] [[was]] pristine when [[I]] [[woke]] up, and her [[morning]] tea [[was]] [[our]] [[new]] routine. [[As]] [[my]] guest, [[she]] [[brought]] gifts and [[the]] [[doctor]]. [[We]] enjoyed Charlie Parker [[on]] [[the]] architectâ€™s CD [[player]], sharing passages [[from]] The Paris [[Review]] and [[my]] own writings. All were in [[bright]] [[humor]] from the change in the season, the shift in the wind. I did [[well]] as a host, as a man. I shaved my [[face]], brushed my teeth, wore my shirt, and owned my life.
