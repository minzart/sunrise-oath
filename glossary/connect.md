This [[one]] [[scene]] [[from]] the film *[[waterloo|Waterloo]]* [[stuck]] out to [[me]]. Napoleon [[is]] dictating letters, and devolves [[into]] lamenting the estrangement of [[his]] precious son. Was [[cool]] to see [[how]] [[someone]] [[could]] compose multiple letters in [[one]] [[sitting]] by saying that was on [[his]] mind, [[then]] [[having]] scribes divide them [[up]] [[after]] the fact. I [[thought]], [[what]] [[stops]] [[me]] [[from]] [[doing]] this myself?
