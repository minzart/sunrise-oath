When you think about [[how]] [[much]] luck is integrated [[into]] your life, it raises the [[question]]: Do you "deserve" more or less success, based on your various strategic decisions? [[Imagine]] getting a divorce with your spouse of 15 years because they are irritable. Turns out, they just had a benign tumour in their brain, which they had taken out [[after]] he suddenly inherited a long [[lost]] relative's huge company. They revert back to the person you fell in love with, get [[married]] with [[someone]] strictly [[better]] than you, and [[leave]] you in your room crying while binging on misordered [[anchovy]] pizza.
