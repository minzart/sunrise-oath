August 2, [[1992]]

On the last evening of a summer [[trip]] to Montreal, I [[shared]] a [[dance]] with the love of [[my]] [[dreams]] on the deck of a St. Lawrence River dinner cruise. I was seventeen, and she looked [[around]] [[my]] [[age]]. [[When]] the last slow [[song]] played — “Nothing [[Broken]] But [[My]] [[Heart]]” by Céline Dion — the wind [[blew]] past and led [[my]] [[eyes]] to her, fluttering her [[shoulder]]-length hair [[against]] her [[bare]] shoulders. The [[blue]] of her cocktail dress, [[pale]] as [[white]] in the waxing [[twilight]], made her [[my]] Cinderella. I [[took]] a breathless step, and [[another]]. [[Face]] to [[face]], I [[saw]] her [[eyes]] — they were [[hazel]], the eyes of the [[beautiful]] [[stranger]].

Wordlessly, [[we]] [[closed]] [[our]] [[distance]]. The wafting scents of shampoo and perfume sent a shiver [[down]] [[my]] spine. The delicate lady in lace-up heels kept her [[head]] [[down]], and hid her flushed [[face]] in [[my]] neck. [[Anyone]] who [[saw]] us surely [[thought]] [[we]] [[were]] young lovers. I looked up at the lights of Montreal [[against]] the sky, and [[pulled]] her closer as the wind picked up. The chilly breeze, her warm [[body]] — [[how]] I froze from a graze, [[how]] I burned from a [[glance]]!

The [[music]] stopped, and the love of [[my]] [[dreams]] [[brought]] her [[face]] to mine, to plant a kiss or [[say]] a [[sweet]] nothing. Her [[lips]] chose neither as she stepped back and [[beamed]] a smile that [[said]] everything.
