Three sisters, the daughters of Italian immigrants, form the first Waterloo generation of the Vici family.  
  
Elaine Vici, eldest sister, gave birth to Eroica out of wedlock.  
  
Elena Robles, middle sister, married first and had Tara.  
  
Eleanor Surry, junior sister, had Rachel as the last of her brood.  
  
The vampires sacrificed power for joy. The de facto leader of the household, Eroica Vici, sought to make the opposite trade. She was a [[seeker]], restless in Eden, and lost her [[song]].
