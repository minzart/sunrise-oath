[[Saw]] Rennie [[today]] at the [[plaza]] near University of [[Waterloo]]. [[Her]] exam [[went]] [[well]], I [[heard]]. [[We]] had Korean [[food]] and talked about recent interests, the weather, [[our]] families, [[culture]], [[politics]], and lifestyle. She [[is]] [[doing]] [[well]]. I often think that [[my]] [[future]] kids would love [[her]] as a family [[friend]]. That drives [[me]] to be a [[better]] [[friend]].
