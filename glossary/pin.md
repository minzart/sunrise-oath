AURORA: Your [[Halifax]] [[trip]].  
  
SOLOMON: You [[should]]'ve [[seen]] it: a beach baked neath the [[sun]], [[white]] as the [[light]] reflecting [[from]] waves in the [[distance]]. No boats or buildings, [[only]] a barren [[horizon]] and the unbroken Atlantic. I discovered, in your [[words]], "[[silence]] in my [[heart]]".  
  
AURORA: Not [[an]] original setting, either.  
  
SOLOMON: Right. The beach, with Juniper.  
  
AURORA: Ah, I'm [[sorry]].  
  
SOLOMON: Aplogizing makes it [[worse]].
