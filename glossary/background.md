If you thought backseat driving was bad, imagine backseat typing, but with two [[people]] talking at me. Everything I am typing is a sort of transmission of what they are saying as I simulate their conflict on what I should say next. One says I should evangelize, and the other says I should talk more about my writing. And I am now telling both of them, and the reader, that these are exactly the same thing. When you read my writing, you are in fact [[interpreting]] my theology.
