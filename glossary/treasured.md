I too might be the product of someone elseâ€™s imagination, breathed onto paper or coaxed onto a white computer screen by the sheer force of will of one as desperate and as deranged as me. Maybe everything you read was the ramblings of a nonexistent entity, of a phantasmal [[puppet]] on ethereal strings.
