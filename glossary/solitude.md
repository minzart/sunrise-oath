insinuations of the fearful light 
posturing in the space between the chirps 

my verse in english jumbles in a zoo, 
mais en français je ne trouve que des plaits 

the more i speak in 漢語 the words of my mother 
nightmares creep in the dark of reveries 

soon as my head departs her navel's warmth 
i find the desert where i built my house 

where lost men find a land to call their own 
dyslectic in dysphoric dismal days 

the empty page has risen from the trunk 
the mother tree amid the salty rock 

can saplings hope to grow from bitter soil 
if only through the nurture of the willow 

by sheltering the tribulated hermit 
may ever see a sprout of restoration 

當我沒長認草江 
希永可欣方 

然每有久識原湖 
望遠以賞圖 

a ball of mystery i treasured long 
in [[marble]] dreams as dragons in repose 

from nether craft worlds persist into chasm 
your regions all collide along the fault 

stare long at kerning someone else has set 
and never level up or pass the stage 

do any others born in foreign lands 
make love to natives better than your own 

green boxes are compartments for the rot 
textbooks have knowledge sworn to our decay 

unwitting rebels creep around the block 
apologies to those to hear me curse 

if color kindles fire then i may burn 
the reddest hues of redness never seen 

a warble of the rooster (cockatiel) 
arouses me who stands on guard in slumber
