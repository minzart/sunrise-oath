[[The]] [[doctor]] [[in]] the turtleneck [[came]] a few times a week, and the blond boy served her masala chai. On slow days, she requested that I keep her [[company]] at her [[table]], and I complied at [[Alain]]’s insistence. We discussed my literary pursuits and my reasons for coming to Montreal, all in French. Hortus’s dictionary [[came]] in handy when I was [[stuck]], for it seemed she [[understood]] no [[English]] beyond a [[word]] here and there; if I [[spoke]] a [[full]] sentence in [[English]], she stared [[til]] I tried again in the [[language]] of la [[belle]] province.
