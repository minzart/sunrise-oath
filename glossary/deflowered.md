[[We]] slept. [[The]] [[sun]] [[rose]] [[on]] [[September]] 23, and [[I]] [[woke]] [[to]] [[a]] [[younger]] [[woman]] [[at]] [[my]] [[computer]], editing [[my]] [[work]] [[with]] [[the]] [[curator]]’s [[blue]] [[almond]] [[eyes]]. Her [[ponytail]] [[was]] neat, her [[perfume]] fresh. [[I]] sipped her tea.

“[[I]] [[went]] [[to]] the [[hotel]], and asked Selene to speak to our [[parents]].” She gave me a novel [[from]] her luggage, the translation of Murakami: South of the [[Border]], West of the [[Sun]]. “The taxi is coming. Miles to [[go]] before I sleep.”

“Didn’t [[get]] enough rest?”

“I never do. You snore worse [[than]] my sister.” She yawned, typed her email in a new file, and stood up. “Tell me when you receive my [[gift]]. You’ll know when you see it.”

She [[put]] on her [[shoes]]. I [[followed]] suit, helping with her bags and suitcases.
