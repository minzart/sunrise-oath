took over in the care of [[Gale]]'s career.

When I lost you to [[Louise]], I realized [[something]]. The [[universe]] won't care about what I [[want]]. I'm the only advocate for [[my]] mind. I'm the only [[one]] who can make [[my]] [[dreams]] come true.  
  
I'll make all [[my]] [[wildest]] [[dreams]] come true. What about you, Gale [[Jones]]?
