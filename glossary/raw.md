Once [[upon]] a [[time]], I stood in a garden, and was tempted to sin. That was my genesis too, as it was [[written]]. Forever the snake is in my memory, and takes itself as a worldly [[mentor]] to the fallen and exiled. In a [[desert]], no water in [[sight]], is the true [[mercy]] and [[grace]] of God.
