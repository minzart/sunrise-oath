No [[one]] was [[missing]] me for another two hours. Settling into a sofa, facing a [[giant]] composite display of three paintings [[from]] three different artists—a medley [[triptych]], I deign to call it—I thought about all the things I keep to myself, that only come to mind when alone in places like these, foreign places where I shall stay a stranger.
