[[Same]] birthdays  
美好  
Catherine of Aragon

Selene's cousin [[Tian]] is travelling home at the [[time]] that he is writing the last words for The [[Wind]] at Dawn.  
  
He [[became]] associated [[with]] Gale [[Jones]] by Selene's intervention and Catherine's support. 


  
That [[night]], I kept [[Louise]] up til morning.  
  
Catherine and I saw each [[other]] for lunch every day. She came over and cooked for [[me]] and [[Louise]]. The [[first]] [[time]] [[Louise]] canceled, Catherine called [[me]] and asked: "Should [[we]] cancel?"  
I [[thought]] about it. "No."  
From then on, she and I met [[alone]] every so often. [[We]] [[even]] went camping together.  
Soon, I talked to Catherine more than [[we]] did [[with]] [[Louise]]. The beauty of her [[duty]] filled my [[heart]].  
  
Catherine's [[heart]] in Gale's hands  
  
"[[If]] you called her just once, she would've stayed. [[If]] you spoke to her on the phone just once when I called you, she would've waited for you forever. How could you forget her like that? How could you [[betray]] [[me]]?"  
  
"I killed her," I realized.  
  
"[[We]] [[loved]] you, Gale [[Jones]]!" I listened to her cry for what was too long, and let my own tears [[flow]]. The call went quiet in the end, and sometime [[after]] that she [[said]] the last words she would spare to [[me]]: "I [[hurt]] you deeper than you [[shall]] ever [[know]], so I forgive you. [[Never]] talk to [[me]] [[again]]."  
  
I hung the beeping line and threw the phone against the wall. Then I fell to the floor defeated, laying vanquished. At sunset on December 22, the winter solstice, the darkest [[night]] of the year was [[only]] getting started.  
  
  
  
In the Bible, Artemis / Diana was made into a souvenir figurine at Ephesus, where her [[temple]] was. See: mission of Paul the Apostle  
  
[[First]] exoplanet discovered in 1992  
  
Selene's lunar birthday falls on the Mid-Autumn Festival.  
  
She had her ceremony at fifteen to be a woman, and then [[one]] at twenty to become a "man" (a legitimate heir) to satisfy her [[personal]] vow of chastity (that she was goaded into [[doing]] as a child).  
  
The autumn equinox is on [[September]] 22, 1980.  
Her Gregorian birthday is [[September]] 23, 1980.  
The autumn equinox is on [[September]] 23, 1999.  
Her twentieth lunar birthday is [[September]] 24, 1999.  
  
Gale knows Selene missed her [[flight]]. This is revealed in couplet four.  
  
Selene is angry Gale turned [[down]] Charlotte, and notes he was okay cheating on his fiancée.  
  
Selene introduces dou dizhu and cartomancy.  
  
Catherine is [[dutiful]], but proud. She is at her worst when she is angry and wrathful.  
Catherine overlooks not the worshippers of the stars.  
Idolatry = Foreign worship = Worship of the stars.  
Catherine kept an [[eye]] on Tara and Gale. She knows that Gale saw Tara in Montreal, and [[later]] mistook [[Louise]] for Dawn.  
  
The [[moon]] is not the [[Moon]].  
[[Our]] [[moon]] is not a sphere orbiting the [[Earth]], but a [[reflection]] of the Sun.  
  
When Gale is [[with]] Selene, he can't ever see Dawn.  
How about this, Gale [[Jones]]: I teach you the [[first]] three of my maxims. In exchange, you be my loyal retainer for [[one]] month. I swear not sunrise oaths, but I [[shall]] sing a Moonlight Serenade.  
Gale acknowledges, accepts, accompanies, accomplishes, and accounts Selene for a month starting from the day of [[Louise]]'s birthday. 1999/08/19 to 1999/09/19 (32 total days spanned, Beethoven 32 variations)  
acknowledge: who she is  
accept: what she is  
accompanies: when and where she is  
accomplishes: [[why]] and how she is  
accounts: five W's and [[one]] H about who she was  
Forevermore, he is the pre-eminent expert of who she was at that [[time]] in her life. Thanks to him, the world [[shall]] be the [[companion]] of that lonely girl.  
  
  
  
Unravel once a year.  
(Gale has trouble [[with]] this [[one]], and Selene kickstarts it by taking unnamed drugs, satisfying her [[duty]] to always fulfill her oaths. The end of this oath satisfaction has them as friends, during which Gale finds out how awkward Selene is when he gives her not the utmost charity. He [[even]] finds her surprisingly immature.)  
Lie once a lifetime.  
(Selene's [[one]] lie in her life is "Selene Bauman", a falsehood she carries forever. Gale's falsehood, it turns out by the end, is Dawn.)  
"My life must [[have]] a fate to be discovered.  
Wealth [[shall]] be lost and be in [[time]] recovered."  
Selene makes Gale thinks of [[Louise]] in part because Selene mentions Sailor [[Moon]], which [[Louise]] liked to talk about.  
[[Louise]] lived in Lyon, Moscow, Beijing, and Tokyo. She does not [[remember]] anything in Paris except the conservatories and the Eiffel tower.  
[[Louise]] reading manga, says she [[wishes]] for a manga about a girl at the Conservatory of Paris.  
Selene remembers [[Louise]] from an event in Hong Kong that she attended while [[young]].  
Gale remembers a [[story]] [[Louise]] told him about a Chinese-German girl she met at a competition who [[also]] liked Sailor [[Moon]]. He realizes that Selene is the girl from that day, and that girl's name was Autumn [[Moon]]. The girl had an [[older]] [[sister]] [[there]], in [[Louise]]'s recollection, who scooped Autumn [[Moon]] up and [[after]] a smack took her out of the hall. Gale realizes that this [[older]] [[sister]] is Spring [[Moon]], the [[same]] name that Selene gave as a translation of her [[sister]]'s name.
