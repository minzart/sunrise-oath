What [[asks]] your [[stars]] of everyone [[below]]?  
[[An]] alpine slope is what the [[heart]] [[shall]] [[know]]  
as paradise and [[heaven]] [[come]] to [[earth]].  
No greater weakness [[idle]] prayers [[show]]  
[[than]] folly of the [[self]], in seeking mirth  
by stating [[one]]'s own transcendental [[worth]].
