[[enter|Enter]] the gates, and see the [[dragon]]'s hoard,
the treasures taken from the selfish world
that bears not [[gold]] and jewels as [[proper]] burdens.

The right of kings to [[rule]] is in his sceptre,
a wooden cane that hangs behind his door.
Arrest your [[fears]], and sing [[forevermore]].
