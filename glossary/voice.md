The wayward [[mage]], [[Primo]], tells Lea of the goddess [[guanyin|Guanyin]], whose love and mercy [[saved]] the [[other]] side of the world. Lea holds the Virgin [[mary|Mary]] as the greatest image of a [[woman]], yet is moved by the projection of her that her new friend conjures up. She tries to refute her [[message]], yet is unable. This is her [[first]] doubt, and leads to her [[being]] receptive to Lucifer's suggestion that [[they]] consult an oracle at the shrine of an abandoned city's [[castle]] on a hill.
