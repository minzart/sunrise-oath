Of course, I [[can]]'t decide this sort of [[thing]]. In fact, I [[can]] consider myself "[[lucky]]" I wasn't [[born]] in some impoverished country [[and]] [[dead]] before [[my]] third birthday because of malaria or AIDS. This is in some way life's "yomi [[luck]]". [[We]] [[are]] [[born]] a certain way [[and]] [[have]] to [[face]] life [[and]] [[other]] [[people]] with the [[skill]] order, [[class]], [[and]] equipment [[we]] [[were]] given at [[birth]].
