[[Even]] [[now]], [[I]] [[do]] [[not]] [[know]] [[what]] [[became]] [[of]] [[my]] [[parents]]. Are [[they]] [[in]] hiding? [[Living]] [[under]] assumed identities, no longer wanting anything to do with the child who abandoned her role? But would they really make no effort to find the [[girl]] they birthed and [[raised]], even if she was an unforgivable [[covenant]] breaker? After leaving a [[note]] bequeathing the family estate to me as some sort of parting [[gift]], did they really vanish and seclude themselves somewhere outside the reach of the worldâ€™s best [[private]] [[eyes]]?
