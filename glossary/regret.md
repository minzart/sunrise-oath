Once upon a [[time]], long ere the dawn that formed the sunrise oath, my sweetheart set a curse on my soul.  
  
She opened the door, and let me in. Across her family's dining table, I handed everything she left behind, and took back the sweater that she liked to wear. Tara watched me put it on, and laughed. < It bore your scent. Now, it bears mine. >  
  
I wished her well, and meant it not til later. The architect and her smile were the same as in the theater parking lot, a year and a half from the start of our courtship. Her three words echoed, and my one word followed the figure that left me alone in the first of the coming flurry.  
  
Putting on my shoes in the foyer that I never saw again, my gaze fixed on the high ceiling of the living room, I heard her say: < I wonder if it's snowing. >  
  
BACK THEN:  
  
< Let's break up. >  
  
< Sure. > OR < I love you. >
