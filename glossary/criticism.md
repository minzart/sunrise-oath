[[Sometimes]] [[evidence]] [[and]] arguments lead [[one]] [[to]] adopt a new [[paradigm]], yet the [[core]] faith never [[changes]]. Also, you have to wonder what someone _[[means]]_ when they use particular words, and if they are expressing the same [[meaning]] as you but in different words. Focusing too much on the words themselves rather than digging for [[meaning]] comes [[from]] the lie that words have [[meaning]]. They do not. Minds have [[meaning]], and words are [[references]] to keys in oneâ€™s existing [[meaning]] library.
