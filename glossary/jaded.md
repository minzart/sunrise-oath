[[Tara]] [[is]] [[Eroica]]'s cousin, [[and]] [[Eroica]] [[was]] [[the]] [[more]] [[dominant]] [[and]] crafty [[of]] [[the]] two. However, [[Tara]] has a [[special]] talent for never [[missing]] the mark, [[whether]] in [[shooting]] [[games]], carnival ball tosses, or clever remarks. She [[also]] is the [[one]] who often foils [[Eroica]]'s plans, [[through]] exercising her own [[will]].
