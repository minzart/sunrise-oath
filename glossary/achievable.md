Bruce Pandolfini, famously portrayed by Ben Kingsley in "Searching for Bobby Fischer", wrote these words:

"Playing chess gives us a [[chance]] to [[start]] out life over [[again]], and this [[time]], no [[one]] has more money than us, no [[one]] is more beautiful, no [[one]] lives in a better neighborhood, and [[we]] all go to the [[same]] school. [[Other]] than [[having]] the [[first]] move (and this benefit is [[shared]] equally) no [[one]] starts with any unfair advantage."

â€“ Bruce Pandolfini, 2000

I think this is enough to show [[why]] I [[have]] such a [[fascination]] for "perfect strategy [[games]]".
