[[I]] [[text]] [[Tara]] that [[I]] wrote [[the]] ending [[of]] [[The]] [[Wind]] [[at]] [[Dawn]]. [[She]] replies within [[a]] minute, making fun [[of]] [[me]] [[for]] picking [[today]] [[of]] [[all]] [[days]]. [[I]] smile [[to]] [[myself]], and put away [[my]] phone. [[I]] include this [[to]] show [[the]] reader that [[life]] goes [[on]], that [[everything]] passes. [[My]] [[life]] [[is]] tragic, but triumphant too. [[Every]] [[life]] has [[triumph]] [[in]] [[the]] [[works]].
