Players start with a grid. They draw or write on the grid, dividing it into labeled zones. The size of the labeled zone determines proficiency / skill / identity.  
  
Characters with mostly empty grids are less experienced, but have more potential for change. Characters with mostly full grids are more [[experienced]], but have less [[potential]] for change.
