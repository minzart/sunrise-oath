[[Tremblay]]’s daughter put the cassette Walkman in a pocket, and took something out from another. “I have something for you,” she said, waving a sealed compact disc. “Abbey Road. Yours, in exchange for Simone’s mixtape.”  
  
“No thanks,” I replied quickly.  
  
“Worth a try.” She giggled, and gave me the [[gift]]. “Next time you watch the sunrise, listen to the first track on side two.”  
  
“Thank you.” I accepted the offering, staring at the [[four]] Beatles, thinking about how music brought so many people together. “I was wondering. What’s your favorite song by John Pizzarelli?”  
  
“Incroyable,” she marveled. “You ask me a big question like that, when you don’t even know my name yet?”  
  
I strained to recall. “Something, [[Tremblay]].”  
  
“I have Sylvie’s last name,” she huffed. “I never thought it would come to this. I told everyone to stay quiet, but you really know nothing.”  
  
I saw she was right. “Let’s start from there. What’s your name?”  
  
“A woman has secrets, you see!” She laughed, and stood from the chair. “I’ll tell you tomorrow. For now, I’m late for the fireworks. Can you see them from the window?”  
  
“Maybe,” I said. “But it’s past my bedtime.”  
  
“Best to get some rest,” she agreed. “I’ll tell you what you missed in the morning, when we pick you up.”  
  
As her silhouette left me behind, I grew anxious. “Wait!” I cried as she stepped out. “Without a name, what part of you belongs to me?”  
  
Her hand rested on the handle. “Tomorrow, you’ll know everything about me. Til then, think of me as a beautiful stranger, as . . .” She hid her blushing face. “. . . Roslyn.”  
  
After Roslyn shut the door behind her, I turned to the woman sitting on my bed, the sunrise companion in the pale blue dress. “I thought I’d never see you again,” I said, and touched her false cheek, felt her imaginary warmth. “What shall I do with you?”  
  
Dawn smiled, as I knew she would. Her fingers brushed the hair from my forehead, and rested on my chest. “Keep me inside, and I’ll be with you forever. So long as you live, our sunrise oath will never die.”  
  
I nodded, and wept. “Life is so long.”  
  
“Time flies when you’re having fun.” She shed her own tears, beads of light illumining the dark hospital room. “The rest of your days start in the morning. For now, let me watch you sleep.”  
  
I lay on the pillow, and let Dawn tuck me in. Dozing off, I saw nothing but the glowing phantom of the summer dinner cruise, the fair ghost of my past. “What was the meaning of all this?” I muttered.  
  
“Beautiful stories. Perfect lies.” As the fireworks started, the love of my dreams faded away with the last night of the millenium. “We won’t forget, Gale Jones.”  
  
Indeed, we never forgot.
