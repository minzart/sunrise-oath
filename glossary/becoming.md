Gale's sunrise oath takes over his life, and he becomes increasingly [[obsessed]] with [[learning]] more about Dawn. He is [[aided]] in his [[search]] by a [[new]] group of friends he meets in Montreal, including Selene Bauman, a Chinese-German [[curator]], and Charlotte Gagnon, a [[doctor]] who becomes a regular at the [[caf√©]] where Gale [[works]]. He [[also]] reconnects with [[Tara]] Robles, [[an]] [[architect]] who he dated in [[high]] [[school]] and his [[first]] [[year]] of university, when he was [[still]] [[an]] engineering [[student]] [[pursuing]] a so-[[called]] normal life.
