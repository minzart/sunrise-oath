There was no point in thinking of her any longer. My heart betrays me, and shows its incisive talent for teaching me a lesson or two. In the years since I have never forgotten about her. Catherine, the [[nurse]] who let me cry in her arms, was to me an older sister and a muse. Her shoulders were slim, and her hand on my head was gentler than the touch of any woman since.
