The Wind at Dawn is a work of literary magical realism that adopts the quaint nostalgia and yearning of Haruki Murakamiâ€™s South of the Border, West of the Sun and the heartfelt experimentation in form and medium of Keinart Lobre's [[One]] Thousand Lies.

The [[novel]] follows Gale as he navigates his relationship with Dawn and the challenges he faces in his [[personal]] and professional life. As he spends more [[time]] with her, he becomes increasingly [[obsessed]] with [[finding]] out her true identity and reconnecting with her. This pursuit becomes all-consuming, causing him to neglect his friendships and writing.

As his relationship with Selene becomes strained, she [[eventually]] leaves Montreal [[without]] warning. Charlotte becomes his [[only]] remaining connection to the [[outside]] world, but she becomes estranged from him when he becomes too focused on [[finding]] Dawn.

[[Ultimately]], Gale realizes that the Dawn he has been pursuing is a [[figment]] of his own imagination and that the woman he [[thought]] he knew never [[actually]] [[existed]]. He is forced to confront the [[consequences]] of his actions and the [[damage]] he has caused to his [[relationships]], and must work to rebuild his life and reconnect with those he has pushed away.

The Wind at Dawn is a [[story]] of [[self]]-[[discovery]] and the [[importance]] of connection and [[relationships]]. It explores the complexities of love and loss, and the power of the imagination to both bring us [[hope]] and lead us [[astray]].
