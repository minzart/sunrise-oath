I wish, for the sake of curing the well, to quell these falsehoods:  
  
- that I am unsympathetic to your experiences as rationalists  
- that I think myself better than anyone  
- that I seek to be confirmed as right  
- that I refuse to be seen or heard as wrong  
- that I seek strife, conflict, or confusion  
- that I take for myself a special place of knowledge or wisdom  
- that I, or anyone here, may have a claim to absolute or higher meaning.  
  
To this end . . .  
  
I take a vow of silence on [[Thursdays]], only broken by a call to speak or noble need. No longer shall I volunteer my spoken thoughts to anyone on this day of the week.  
  
I forgo membership in the Kitchener-Waterloo Rationality Discord server, leaving room for those whom my long and frequent writings have crowded out.  
  
I offer invitation to join me on Sundays from 1 and 5, to speak of anything we please.  

They only ask a [[question]] if it confirms their fundamental values.
