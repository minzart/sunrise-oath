[[I]] [[point]] [[to]] [[the]] [[story]] [[of]] [[Thomas]] needing [[to]] [[put]] [[his]] finger [[in]] the wounds of Jesus. If it were the case that Mormonism depends less on the sources of evidence that you listed (I will leave my opinion on that out, for it is irrelevant), it would seem to only say that the minimum threshold of their faith seems to be even higher, and so they are likely even more [[faithful]]. (Hahaâ€¦) I discourage the frame of feeling being worse affirmation than research. In fact, the latter is also at its [[root]] feeling. Knowledge is knowledge, and whether it is wrong or right is between the mind and God.
