[[Emma]] was in my [[French]] [[class]], and knew all [[along]] [[why]] [[Lauren]] asked [[me]] for [[help]] and not her. She gave [[me]] the [[cold]] [[shoulder]] for the rest of [[high]] [[school]], [[placed]] higher than [[me]] in school [[writing]] contests, [[started]] [[an]] online student [[magazine]] in senior [[year]], and went to [[an]] expensive [[private]] college somewhere, [[finding]] herself as part of the neoliberal [[old]] guard on campus (or so I [[heard]] from [[Thomas]]). [[Never]] closer than friends of friends, [[our]] [[falling]] out was worth no [[regrets]].
