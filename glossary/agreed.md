This [[promise]] was not meant to be, for that [[same]] week I skipped the movie date [[we]] planned—the [[first]] [[Avengers]] film at the Boardwalk—[[with]] the excuse that I was not allowed to date a [[white]] girl. I [[forgot]] [[why]] I wanted to get out of the date, but I [[remember]] how she [[said]] she hated [[me]], how I almost revealed the lie but revealed not, how she blocked [[me]] on Facebook and told [[Emily]] and [[Iscah]], her loyal Jewish friends who gave [[me]] [[an]] earful the next day and made [[me]] their enemy.
