[[The]] mermaid [[turned]] [[around]], surprised. “[[You]]’re [[not]] drowning,” [[I]] [[heard]] [[through]] [[the]] [[water]].  
  
“[[I]]’m [[not]] [[of]] [[this]] [[world]],” [[I]] [[explained]]. “[[Rules]] apply [[not]].”  
  
“[[How]] [[I]] [[wish]] [[to]] [[be]] [[you]],” [[she]] sighed, and slowly approached. Her lips [[grazed]] my neck. “This too is destiny.”

Created anew by the [[sculptor]], made perfect by the lust and longing of Pygmalion, granted life in the [[imagination]] of the one that [[beholds]] you and owns you.

I know not your face, yet I know of the wish that were were face to face I may never come to see as it is. The veil of distance, the bird in soaring flight, was the messenger of your heart. A stranger, one never meant to grace the other's home, is the prize of possibility.
