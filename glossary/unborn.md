Gale imagines Dawn as a [[figment]] of his own [[imagination]] as a sort of [[self]]-[[delusion]] that gives him [[hope]]. He feels that his life is boring, and that he has never truly wanted for anything [[material]]. For him, the [[beautiful]] [[stranger]] he [[met]] seven [[years]] ago was a [[perfect]] enigma to carry with him forever. The [[fake]] version of Dawn [[first]] appeared after Canada [[Day]]; during a thunderstorm in the [[early]] [[morning]] of July 2, 1999, he [[said]] that he would finally go back to the [[Old]] [[Port]] of Montreal [[if]] the rain stopped before sunrise. It did, and so he went and gave himself [[hope]] in the way he knew [[best]]: [[lying]] to himself.
