Quiet Quinine [[is]] instantly the favorite student of Ms. A. Helen Sharp, as the wife of Mr. Stern and the mother of his child.  
  
Mr. Stern [[is]] a bit of a liar and tells tall tales about his accomplishments, which Alacrity [[is]] quiet about. She knows that he turned [[down]] working from NASA so he could take care of their newborn child as she finished school. "Get your degree, Lacri." He was almost pushy about it. "I [[shall]] do everything for you and the child." He lies to cover up the [[pain]] of putting his [[career]] aside. He [[never]] realized he could love his wife so much.  
  
Lacri feels like she has to justify the [[sacrifice]] that her husband made. She wants him to [[never]] [[regret]] his decision.
