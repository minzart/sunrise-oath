Grant lives [[the]] [[same]] [[life]], [[day]] [[by]] [[day]]. [[On]] [[the]] day of an important [[meeting]], he sees that [[he]] lost his wedding [[ring]].  
  
[[He]] [[leaves]] [[his]] [[workplace]] [[to]] [[find]] [[the]] [[ring]], retracing [[the]] places where he might have been. His [[job]] requires that he [[forgets]] the events of the day, and so he must recreate the events with the help of a woman.  
  
A fortune teller, so young that she could have been his daughter, invites him into her tent. She says a detail about him that he never expected to hear: she knows that he was thinking about divorce.  
  
A police officer kicks her out [[from]] her operation. Grant intervenes on her [[behalf]], using his good reputation to help her. In return, he [[asks]] that she help him in his recovery of the [[ring]].  

Grant and Ayla use his free time away [[from]] his wife and his work to [[search]] for the [[ring]].
