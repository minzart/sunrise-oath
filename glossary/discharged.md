ROSE

[[Oh]],

and

then,

in my

fated

wife's

lovely

fiction,

Rose —

the love,

the smell,

the flower, 

the thorns,

the beauty;

the [[dreams]],

the [[sun]] rose,

the color [[pink]],

the [[new]] morn;

the distant past,

the sunrise oath;

the wind at dawn,

the clouds in flock,

the [[earth]] and stars,

the [[moon]] and [[night]],

the might and worlds,

the [[sea]] and red and kiss,

the tangle and [[light]] enow,

the leap and blast and rush,

the unseen and upborne and ride.

the strength and [[triumph]] and [[meeting]],

the [[story]] [[told]] by [[me]] to you the dear [[stranger]] —

I [[found]] the hints that make her name: Sarah Carice [[Beaulieu]].
