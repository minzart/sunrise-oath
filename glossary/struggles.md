The novel is structured [[around]] the art [[song]] of the [[same]] name by Edward [[Elgar]] and Caroline Alice Roberts. Each of the eight chapters corresponds to a couplet in the [[song]]. The [[first]] chapter, "And the wind went out to meet with the [[sun]]...At the dawn when the [[night]] was [[done]]," [[sees]] Gale reunite with Dawn and they make a sunrise oath to help each [[other]] out.

In the second chapter, "And he racked the clouds in lofty [[disdain]]...As they flocked in his airy train," Gale starts working at the [[café]] Génoise et Thé, where he meets the owner [[Alain]] [[Tremblay]], the cook [[Hortus]], and the customers Charlotte Gagnon and Selene Bauman. Charlotte is a doctor who becomes a regular at the [[café]], and Selene is a Chinese-German [[curator]].

In the third chapter, "And the [[earth]] was grey, and grey was the sky...In the hour when the stars [[must]] [[die]]," Gale has a date with Dawn at La Ronde, but instead spends the day with his ex-girlfriend Tara Robles, who is [[pregnant]] with her [[current]] boyfriend David Hawthorn's child.

In the fourth chapter, "And the [[moon]] had fled with her sad, wan [[light]]...For her [[kingdom]] was [[gone]] with [[night]]," Gale discovers discipline and art [[through]] Selene, but [[also]] realizes that she has [[been]] [[lying]] to him about various [[things]].

In the fifth chapter, "Then the [[sun]] upleapt in might and in power...And the worlds woke to hail the hour," Gale isolates himself and [[only]] Charlotte is [[there]] for him. When he finally [[sees]] Dawn [[again]] and satisfies their sunrise oath, his obsession with her pushes Charlotte away.

In the sixth chapter, "And the [[sea]] streamed red from the kiss of his brow...[[There]] was [[glory]] and [[light]] enow," Gale's search for Dawn puts [[off]] [[Alain]], but earns the sympathy of [[Hortus]]. Selene reveals that she is a [[witch]] and curses Gale to be [[bound]] to his greatest lie, though he does not yet [[know]] what it is.

In the seventh chapter, "To his tawny mane and tangle of flush...Leapt the wind with a blast and a rush," Gale is despondent and [[lonely]] after realizing that Dawn is not [[real]]. In a drunken episode on Christmas, he falls [[into]] the [[Saint]] Lawrence River.
