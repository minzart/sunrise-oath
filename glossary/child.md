“I’m home. I’m cold.” Her eyes flitted. “It’s [[me]], [[diana|Diana]]. It’s [[dark]] and lonely on the [[other]] side.”

In a rocking boat on the winding shore,  
[[seven]] mages gave the world eternal life.  
  
All the angry men in my native land  
see upon my brow another foreign face.  
  
No [[other]] God but [[Jesus]] Christ  
may be the Caesar's ecstasy.  
  
A fate is God’s. A choice is yours.
