[[I]] went [[back]] above [[the]] bleachers, watching [[the]] [[rest]] [[of]] [[the]] [[game]] and letting [[the]] rain cool [[off]] [[my]] hormones. [[In]] [[the]] [[end]], [[our]] side [[lost]] [[the]] [[game]] by [[one]] point — [[a]] [[rouge]], [[said]] [[Timothy]]. [[The]] field [[became]] [[a]] [[gold]]-beige-brown victory display, and [[we]] [[the]] [[conquered]] [[looked]] [[on]] bitterly and booed Canadian football [[rules]]. [[Our]] [[school]]’s [[cheerleaders]] [[performed]] [[not]] [[again]]. [[My]] [[friend]] mentioned [[an]] [[after]]-party [[at]] [[an]] upper year’s [[house]], but [[I]] [[made]] [[an]] excuse and went [[to]] search [[for]] [[Tara]] Robles [[in]] [[the]] [[dispersing]] crowd [[outside]] [[the]] arena.
