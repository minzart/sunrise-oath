[[I]] was fond of Ancra Atlas, though he was not my friend. I went with the flow and kept my grades up, while his [[calling]] was to be a writer. He was more like an adult brother than a boy in my grade, pronounced by how we wore our fathersâ€™ suits on the night of the dinner cruise. Lapels and [[shoulder]] pads made not the boy a man. He was in a world apart, one of the chosen dreamers, thanks to the blessings of three girls who knew his [[potential]]. Two of them, the [[engineer]] and the pianist, were with us in Montreal. They discussed classical [[music]], and I let Ancra [[talk]] about [[politics]]. When he asked what caught my eye, I [[mounted]] the steps rather than explain that I saw someone.
