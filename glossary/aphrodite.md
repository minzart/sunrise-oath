[[My]] [[fianc√©e]] [[and]] [[I]] rarely [[met]] [[alone]] [[in]] [[private]]. [[I]] stayed [[over]] [[at]] [[Louise]]'s [[place]] [[only]] [[once]], [[after]] [[having]] [[sex]] [[in]] [[her]] remodeled garage.  
  
_[[We]] [[are]] so in love,_ she [[said]] that [[night]], and pressed her naked [[body]] [[against]] [[me]]. _I pray tonight [[will]] not ruin it._  
  
It was on Valentine's [[Day]] earlier that [[year]]. She had a [[shock]] earlier that evening, and wanted [[me]] by her side. That brush [[with]] death [[changed]] her, and made her so [[beautiful]]. She was loud, a sighing soprano seductress, and was more sensual [[than]] she [[ever]] was before.  
  
The [[beauty]] of her love filled [[my]] [[heart]].  
  
  
Charlotte skipped two grades and attended Westmount [[High]] [[School]], then Vincent d'Indy. [[After]] a [[year]], she [[changed]] over to becoming a [[doctor]]. She [[comes]] to [[marry]] her rival [[from]] her days as a cellist.  
  
[[Louise]] wanted to [[hurt]] [[Gale]] by kissing [[Ancra]], so that she [[has]] no right to be angry. She [[helped]] [[history]] be on his side.  
  
[[Gale]] once [[told]] Charlotte that he was talking to Dawn at the [[table]], and Charlotte does a [[double]] take. She [[only]] puts it [[together]] herself [[after]] she cannot ignore it anymore. [[After]] Selene's [[lies]], Charlotte becomes [[tormented]] by their very [[existence]].
