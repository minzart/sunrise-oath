[[My]] fianc√©e and I rarely met alone in private. I stayed over at [[Louise]]'s place only once, [[after]] having sex in her remodeled garage.  
  
_[[We]] are so in love,_ she said that night, and pressed her naked [[body]] against me. _I pray tonight will not ruin it._  
  
It was on Valentine's Day earlier that year. She had a [[shock]] earlier that evening, and wanted me by her side. That brush [[with]] death changed her, and made her so beautiful. She was loud, a sighing soprano seductress, and was more sensual than she ever was before.  
  
The beauty of her love filled [[my]] heart.  
  
  
Charlotte skipped two grades and attended Westmount High School, then Vincent d'Indy. [[After]] a year, she changed over to becoming a doctor. She comes to marry her rival from her days as a cellist.  
  
[[Louise]] wanted to hurt Gale by kissing Ancra, so that she has no right to be angry. She helped history be on his side.  
  
Gale once told Charlotte that he was talking to Dawn at the table, and Charlotte does a double take. She only puts it together herself [[after]] she cannot ignore it anymore. [[After]] Selene's lies, Charlotte becomes tormented by their very existence.  
  
(She lied to her husband that she miscarried. He wanted her husband to never be disappointed in her.)  
Charlotte never told anyone she was married. It was their own personal thing.  
  
Charlotte makes a "mix tape" of jazz standards she listened to [[with]] Gale and Selene.  
  
What should I do, Charlotte?  
  
For now, sleep. That's the [[best]] thing you can do.  
  
It's not enough.  
  
Gale Jones. (She smiles.) If your [[best]] [[is]] not enough, then whatever can the rest of us do?
