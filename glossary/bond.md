Rachel [[said]] [[to]] [[meet]] [[her]] [[for]] lunch [[at]] [[the]] Pub [[on]] [[King]]. Sent [[at]] [[sunrise]], [[no]] [[question]] mark. Checking [[my]] phone [[an]] [[hour]] before noon, [[I]] [[saw]] [[her]] [[message]] [[late]], [[right]] [[as]] [[I]] had [[the]] [[time]] [[to]] brew [[a]] [[coffee]]. [[Telling]] Juniper [[I]] had [[to]] [[leave]] earlier, [[I]] headed [[out]] [[and]] [[took]] [[a]] bus [[to]] Uptown. Debating [[whether]] [[to]] [[get]] [[a]] [[new]] [[vape]] [[at]] [[Your]] Highness [[down]] [[the]] street, [[I]] chose [[to]] sit [[down]] [[early]] [[and]] nurse [[a]] Diet Coke.

Ten minutes [[late]], [[she]] showed [[up]] [[in]] [[the]] clothes [[she]] wore [[last]] week, minus Ray-Bans. [[Lost]] track [[of]] [[time]], or skipped [[her]] laundry [[day]]? [[I]] dared [[not]] [[think]] [[which]] [[answer]], [[and]] [[so]] Iet [[her]] [[kiss]] [[my]] cheek and order our two entrées, one appetizer—and a bottle of rosé, two glasses. My cousin, dear Aunt Rachel, waited for the server to leave, and buried her face in her hands.

“Ruined, Solomon. What shall I do?”

My [[eyes]] searched—for nosy strangers, for hints of tears, for bruises on her skin. Why here, for what, by who?

“Another day, a brand new circumstance.” She lifted her head, and to my surprise was calm, assured. “The die is cast. I left the start-up.”

“Left? What about your equity?” 

“Gone.” The software developer enunciated, and smiled at her own [[joke]]. Like always, she was one step [[ahead]] of me—one year my senior, one level wiser. What was the [[meaning]] of this?

Our small talk carried on as every week, as if her declaration never happened. The [[food]] arrived, and only then I saw she drank both glasses. She went to fill them, but put the bottle down and took an onion ring.

“Crunch time had me feeling down. I never missed so much sleep in my life.”

I nodded, though I could not understand. “This was your keystone graduation project. Your baby.”

She shrugged, a tiny lift of two slight shoulders, and stuck out her tongue. “Is this your way of saying I had an abortion?” A snicker, then a pensive sip of water. “Sometimes, I wonder how it ever happened. I cannot for the life of me remember what I saw in it.”

“It could have changed the world.” Or so the [[Record]] printed, when they won the pitch competition.

The co-founder shook her head. “It never was about that. I just wanted to make something with my friends.”
