The [[pianist]] died on November 12, 1999. That night brought the first snowfall in Montreal. I know, because I looked it up two decades [[later]], checking if it snowed on the night the [[lawyer]] came to tell me the news. Details slip with [[time]], and I no longer know fact from fiction. Two decades into the new millenium, I begin the process of document the [[truth]]. Not the [[truth]] according to something [[outside]] of me, but as a reflection of who it is that tells this story.  
  
I stormed out of the [[caf√©]] where I once worked, and took a walk with a former [[coworker]]. [[We]] sat on a bench at the Old [[Port]] and I spoke of the love of my dreams, the one no one else remembered. The [[blond]] [[boy]] looked me in the eye, examining me, then lamented how it was to be a runaway.  
  
On my way home, I felt that someone was following me. Not wanting to alert them, I kept my pace til the end of the block, then turned the corner and ran past a stranger. A few beats [[later]], I heard a yelp, a familiar sound. I turned, and saw in the dim streetlights that a woman bumped into the same person I passed.
