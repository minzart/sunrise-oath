[[When]] Newton saw an apple fall, he found
In that slight startle [[from]] his contemplation —
'Tis said (for I'll not answer above [[ground]]
For any sage's creed or calculation) —
A mode of proving that the Earth [[turned]] round
In a [[most]] natural whirl, [[called]] “gravitation“;
And this is the sole mortal who could grapple,
Since Adam — with a fall — or with an apple.

Man [[fell]] with apples, and with apples rose,
If this be [[true]]; for we must deem the mode
In which Sir Isaac Newton could disclose
Through the then unpaved stars the turnpike road,
A thing to counterbalance human woes:
For, [[ever]] since, [[immortal]] man hath glowed
With all kinds of mechanics, and [[full]] [[soon]]
Steam-engines [[will]] conduct him to the moon.
