I [[wish]] to cure the poisoned [[well]] of these falsehoods:  
  
- that I care not about your experiences as rationalists;  
- that I [[put]] myself above [[anyone]];  
- that I [[seek]] to be confirmed as right;  
- that I refuse to be [[seen]] or [[heard]] as [[wrong]];  
- that I [[seek]] [[strife]], conflict, or confusion;  
- that I take for myself a [[special]] [[place]] of knowledge or wisdom;  
- that I, or [[anyone]] here, [[may]] [[have]] a claim to [[absolute]] or higher [[meaning]].  
  
I [[also]] [[wish]] to solve a key tension in my values. Everything I [[say]] proactively violates either my [[standard]] for the group's purpose (promoting rationalist principles), or my [[conscience]] on the group's wellbeing (breaking rationalist [[frame]] [[bias]]). This shall not continue.
