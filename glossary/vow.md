I wish to cure the poisoned well of these falsehoods:  
  
- that I care not about your experiences as rationalists;  
- that I put myself above [[anyone]];  
- that I seek to be confirmed as right;  
- that I refuse to be seen or heard as [[wrong]];  
- that I seek [[strife]], conflict, or confusion;  
- that I take for myself a [[special]] place of knowledge or wisdom;  
- that I, or [[anyone]] here, may [[have]] a claim to [[absolute]] or higher meaning.  
  
I also wish to solve a key tension in my values. Everything I say proactively violates either my standard for the group's purpose (promoting rationalist principles), or my [[conscience]] on the group's wellbeing (breaking rationalist frame bias). This shall not continue.  
  
And so . . .  
  
I [[keep]] [[silence]] on Thursdays, excepting direct call to [[speak]] or noble need. I shall not volunteer my spoken thoughts to [[anyone]], in the group or otherwise, on this day of the week. I will answer pertinent questions by assent.  
  
I forgo membership in the Kitchener-Waterloo Rationality Discord server, leaving room for those [[whom]] my long, esoteric, and frequent writings [[have]] crowded out.  
  
I offer invitation to join [[me]] on Sundays from 1 and 5, to make art and [[speak]] of anything we please.  
  
Consider this my sincere effort to quarantine my interests and cleanse the conversation. So long as you will [[have]] [[me]], I hope to show my depth of care by [[presence]] and action. I love you all, brothers and sisters.
