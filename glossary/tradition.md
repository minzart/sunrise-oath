**The first Duality cards were sleeved in front of Magic (poker-sized) cards, and placed on a grid drawn in pencil on a [[white]] Ikea coffee table. Players are instructed to understand these origins, then to create cards and play the game in any way they wish.**

Traditionally, [[time]]-old rituals have been forgotten. May everything here be lost to the sands, should they no longer serve the game.
