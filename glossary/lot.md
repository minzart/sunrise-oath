* * *
Gale lived not a normal life. He lived the best of lives. He never appreciated his past life, because he was so happy he knew not even what there was to be thankful for. He felt unseen, but he was popular without knowing it. He realizes he threw his past life away with no regard for it.  
  
Gale's father is the school principal, a former science teacher. Gale's mother is a writer and classicist. Eroica chooses Gale over his mother. Eroica schemed to get her and her friends closer to a popular kid, and the son of a famous writer. Catherine was rude to Gale out of jealousy, and Tara bullied her as revenge on Gale's behalf. Catherine saw that Gale was not like other popular people. Gale noticed not that Louise's English improved over the years, because he could afford to disregard people. Ancra thought of himself as Gale's sidekick. He tells Gale he could have protected Louise, and almost admitted the kiss.  
  
Tara remade her image so they would be socially compatible. Before, she was not aware of popular people because she was so shut in. If he told her to, she would've stayed with him forever. She wanted to feel like she meant enough that he would stop her from leaving. He lived too well to realize how deeply someone can love.  
  
Catherine tells Gale to not tell Louise that Tara used to bully her in freshman year. She wanted not to bring up the past, or pit Louise against Tara.  
  
Gale withdraws all his money, his personal savings, to give to Alain. Gale finds out he was hallucinating Dawn, and gives his money to Walking Eagle. Walking Eagle makes sure that the people from the [[caf√©]] got the money, then disappeared. Him giving the [[Tremblay]] family Gale's money is what triggers the events of Christmas 1999.  
  
When Gale leaves for Montreal, Louise's decision is to wait with the child inside her.  
  
Gale and David talked about Tara without naming her. Gale describes an ex-girlfriend, David describes his current relationship. Gale gives David advice.  
  
Tara knew that Gale knew. She and Catherine were already uneasy friends, and she was fond of Louise in an idolizing way. It hurt that the man and woman she loved most ended up together.  
  
Tara admits she sometimes thinks of Gale while with David. When she asks if she ever thought of her, she gets huffy when he says no.  
  
Tara then says she never thought of anyone else with Gale, and asks him. He says he thought of Judy Garland for a brief moment during Fascinating Rhythm, and also of Audrey Hepburn. Tara is mad but can't express it.  
  
Tara has seen David for two years, but is unsure of the next step. She offers Gale to elope together, if he chooses her over Louise. He is unsure, esp. as he has met David once. Catherine knew about them dating, but revealed it not and warned him to keep quiet, to keep the peace. She tells him to call her before her birthday on the winter solstice, as at twenty-four she shall move on.  
  
Tara wanted to call him when she got pregnant, but had not his number (Eroica refused to help, wanting to keep the peace). She could not ask anyone for his number and she preferred it this way, so she can know Gale's answer to her question. This selfishness is something she regrets.  
  
November 11: Gale sees Walking Eagle.  
Thomas hurts Gale, so Gale denies Thomas.  
  
"You know why my parents named me Thomas?"  
"After Aquinas."  
"Wrong. Doubting Thomas. The guy who stuck his finger in a hole on the Messiah's [[body]]."  
  
  
I took out my wallet and riffled through bills. In the end, I stuffed them all in his hands. "Will you manage?"  
"I have to. Thanks." He took the money and spread it among his pockets. The eye of Elizabeth II stared through a hole. "Hey, can I use your shower? I'm kinda itchy."  
"Maybe another time. Sorry."  
  
(Gale gave Walking Eagle all the money he earned from Genoise et The and Selene.)  
  
November 12: A shadow follows Gale. He calls for Charlotte, Selene, Tara, Catherine, Louise, and Dawn.  
  
Gale calls Tara first, hanging up before she can explain anyyhing (she says Thank God as her first words to him), and then calls Louise. Only after talking to Catherine (who knew about the elopement situation with Tara at La Ronde and his love for Dawn, after Gale calls out both those names on November 12) does he learn the truth, that Louise died, and was planning on giving their child to her father.  
  
Tara explains that Eroica was somewhat in shock that things went not according to plan, and suggests that Gale call Ancra. "Help her, so she'll help you. She always has a way with problems, you know that!"  
  
Eroica is revealed to be the shadow from November 12, dispatched by Catherine to investigate. In Gale's nightmares, the shadow is Louise haunting him.  
  
He used up his once in a lifetime lie, so the lie he wanted --- that he is meant to be a great writer --- cannot be brought about. All he can write about is Dawn.  
He never wrote anything of his full potential until he began to write about Dawn, about the painful memory of the ghost he loved.
