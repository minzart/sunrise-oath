Hold to the past, and never let it loose.
Angels graced you with their oversight.
Remember when the world came crashing down, when nothing ever felt the same again?

Residual pains accumulated slowly, and you were not prepared to find yourself in no man's land adrift.
The old [[paradigm]] was lost, and none were found save the demons in the deep.
