Three months of hermitage made me [[forget]] the pace of [[society]]. I left behind my Belmonts, a fact [[every]] cell in my body knew when I was at the café [[from]] two days ago, the [[morning]] after the [[storm]]. My body was [[sore]], my mind in a fog. I was nervous about my French, but resolved to do my best. I [[read]] [[aloud]] the name: Génoise et Thé. [[Again]]: Génoise et Thé.
