I [[find]] a tear in the [[fabric]] of [[reality]], and [[tug]] at the seams to [[let]] myself [[through]], tunneling [[through]] to a [[deep]] [[abyss]]. [[Far]] [[from]] the [[current]] [[moment]], the flames [[are]] as [[they]] [[are]] and take the form of the dragons and demons I [[know]] [[only]] [[from]] memory. The [[great]] [[burden]] of the past weighs on [[me]], but not as it [[used]] to. No [[one]] [[should]] [[have]] to carry [[their]] own corpse.

A voice [[calls]] to [[me]]. [[Aphrodite]]. The [[most]] neglected of them! [[There]] [[she]] sits [[across]] [[from]] [[me]] at Génoise, [[crying]] a single tear, [[having]] [[her]] [[coffee]] and smiling [[through]] the bitterness. “Always [[so]] selfish,” [[she]] [[says]], less accusing [[me]] [[than]] jotting [[down]] a diagnosis. “[[Have]] you considered [[how]] [[much]] I wanted you to [[be]] [[happy]]?”

I [[saw]] [[her]] struggle, and it confused [[me]]. Was I worthy of love, of [[beauty]]? [[Why]] would [[anyone]], [[let]] [[alone]] [[an]] [[angel]], [[sacrifice]] themselves for [[me]]? [[Something]] like that belonged in [[fairy]] tales, not in [[whatever]] world I made [[my]] [[home]]. [[Standing]] [[from]] the [[table]], I [[say]]: “[[Let]]’s [[get]] some fresh air.”
