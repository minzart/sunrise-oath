But she has apparently [[forgotten]] about that [[magical]] evening back in August [[1992]]. Since the last [[time]] he [[came]] to the [[city]], she [[lost]] all [[memories]] of her past. [[Now]] as [[listless]] as she is nameless, the young woman reveals little of her [[current]] life except that she always [[comes]] to the [[Old]] [[Port]] of Montreal at break of day. And so [[there]] on [[early]] mornings Gale meets with his [[new]] [[friend]] “Dawn” to make [[good]] on their [[new]] [[promise]]: she [[will]] [[help]] him [[fall]] in love with the sunrise, and he [[will]] [[help]] her find her name.
