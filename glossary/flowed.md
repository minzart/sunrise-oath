Surely there was a last time I saw her, but I cannot remember. After I was released from my protective custody, I found Catherine (again, the Russian divorcée—the former lover wanted nothing to do with me, that is [[til]] we started sleeping together again) on Facebook, and sent her a message thanking her for her kindness, and my sense that I would always love her. She replied with a heart, and blocked me.
