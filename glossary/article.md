As your [[editor]], [[my]] favorite part of The [[Wind]] at Dawn is the emotional journey of Gale as he struggles to find his voice and [[develop]] his writing, while [[being]] [[distracted]] by his obsession [[with]] Dawn. I particularly enjoy the way the art song by [[Elgar]] and Roberts is [[woven]] into the [[story]], and how it reflects the [[themes]] and [[events]] of the [[novel]].
