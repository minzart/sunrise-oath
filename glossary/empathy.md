Thought of a short way to convey the idea. This is a pair of thought experiments that may be impossible to resolve, but I think works as [[food]] for thought. 1. Would you rather have only the original manuscripts of the Gospel but they are impossible to translate or read, or have perfect translations into every language but the manuscripts are lost forever? 2. Would you rather have the complete intended [[meaning]] of the Gospel beamed into the heads of every person, or would you rather have the completely perfectly translated text of the Gospel beamed into their heads?
