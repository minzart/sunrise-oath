Now and forever, I will remain a daydreamer. I will freely make my escape from the realities of today. I will have a place to hide in a time of need, where the truths of the human experience might be too much to bear all at once. When the world at large cannot find me, take it on faith that I am at the barricade overlooking Alexandra Basin, searching for those lost possibilities left to die in the space between passing moments. And in spite of that, back then and there at the window of that hospital room, I was firmly in the present. A new day came to greet Montreal, the city I chose and will forever keep. I, a frenetic traveler, had faith that many clear days were in store for that small corner of the sky. I, a lonely firework out of sight and out of mind of the world at large, promised to forever bear witness to the transformations from rain to shine, from summer to winter, from dawn to dusk, from night to day. I, standing west of the brilliant sun that rose to shine through the clouds upon a new millenium, was exactly where I was meant to be.
