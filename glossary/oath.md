I take a name, and give you [[one]] I had. You show a [[hand]], and say a [[word]] of [[grace]]. [[Enlightenment]]—the end, and then a [[start]].

EXT. LAUREL CREEK CONSERVATION AREA CAMPSITE

October 1997

Sounds of the world of the fleeing [[moon]].

CATHERINE
I now [[know]] the difference between sunset and sunrise. [[Hope]]. That was all [[we]] ever needed. 

GALE
(Not a shred of sarcasm.)
Looks like your confidence is back.

CATHERINE
No more doubts. Everything is clear as day.


I [[know]] that I will never forget her tears under the [[light]] of the [[moon]]. But for two minutes, I put the [[thought]] aside and watch the sunrise with the engineer. [[After]] a restless [[night]], the rays stung my eyes.

~In [[other]] words, I love you.
