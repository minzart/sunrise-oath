[[As]] dismissive [[and]] indifferent [[as]] he was of the practices of other [[magical]] families, Father could not [[help]] but also be fond of the [[company]] of these accomplished pedagogues and pioneers. Not that anyone [[else]] minded these warm friendships. Their [[frequent]] visits kept days fresh and lively, and it gave purpose to Motherâ€™s meticulous decoration of our large residence. My best childhood memories were of [[sitting]] with Father and his companions while Mother would [[toil]] with [[dinner]] preparations. The looks on the faces of those men [[when]] they discussed new discoveries and technological advancements [[convinced]] me that I would [[one]] [[day]] [[join]] them as equals.
