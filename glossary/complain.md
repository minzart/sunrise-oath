[[Once]] [[upon]] [[a]] [[time]], [[my]] [[dream]] was to marry the pianist, the one who performed with our [[high]] school orchestra at the Christmas concert. In eleventh grade, she [[came]] to Waterloo from Paris — France, not Ontario. She was the [[live]]-in friend of the [[engineer]], at least the dynast’s daughter who grew up to be the [[engineer]]. They [[came]] to school by car, sat [[together]] in their classes, and slept in one [[bed]], as only blood [[sisters]] and rich girls did. [[Around]] the [[clock]], they [[spoke]] in fast French that I could not [[understand]]. I never was a [[part]] of their world, even after our summer trip to Montreal. I got along with the pianist, and quarreled with the [[engineer]]. Life is [[strange]]: the pianist [[should]] have stayed a stranger, but became my [[fiancée]] with the [[engineer]]’s [[blessing]].
