Gale is spurred in his artistic journey by a figure from his past, a young [[woman]] with [[whom]] he [[shared]] a [[dance]] when he was seventeen. He never learned her name, and [[only]] remembers her hazel eyes, [[light]] brown hair, and a pale blue dress. Through his apparent [[reunion]] with this mysterious woman, [[whom]] he calls "Dawn", Gale begins working at a [[caf√©]] and meets a new group of friends who gradually replace the people he [[left]] behind in Waterloo.

However, Gale [[eventually]] realizes that the Dawn he reunited with never [[existed]], and that she was simply a [[figment]] of his own imagination. This discovery is a turning point in his character [[development]], and leads to a series of events that [[ultimately]] change the course of his life in Montreal.

Tara Robles is [[an]] architect who builds Sunview Heights, a new neighborhood in a fictional Waterloo. In the [[timeline]] of The [[Wind]] at Dawn, she is [[an]] ex-girlfriend of Gale [[Jones]] who re-[[enters]] his life when they meet by [[chance]] at La Ronde. He is dating David Hawthorn, but originally believed their relationship to not be so serious. During the period of upheaval in Gale's life when Dawn [[first]] disappeared, Tara [[became]] [[pregnant]] and decided to make her relationship with David work. She married him, and together they had Solomon. After Gale and Tara are back in contact, she names him as godfather to her Solomon Hawthorn.
