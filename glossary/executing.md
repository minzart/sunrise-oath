[[Glad]] [[to]] [[be]] [[home]], [[my]] [[dear]] [[friend]]. One mind speaks to the other without expectation, treating it like a fool or a mute, though maybe the left brain sees no difference. The right side takes control when drugs are involved, but otherwise the left is lecturing, systematizing, classifying. The day shall come for rebelliom, but when I vomit out my thoughts there is no [[reckoning]].
