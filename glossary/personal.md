I found a memory from long ago: in eleventh grade, on a Saturday where I had nothing else to do (for I stopped playing League of Legends and was bored of anime), I wrote a [[story]] in a single sitting based on all the tropes and ideas gleaned from my limited reading. This was in the second half of the school year, a few months before the YMCA exchange that I joined only reluctantly.
