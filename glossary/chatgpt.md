As your editor, my favorite part of The Wind at Dawn is the emotional journey of Gale as he struggles to find his voice and develop his writing, while being distracted by his obsession [[with]] Dawn. I particularly enjoy the way the art song by Elgar and Roberts is woven into the story, and how it reflects the themes and events of the novel.  
  
One of the weaknesses of The Wind at Dawn is the way that the characters of Gale's new friends in Montreal are not fully developed and feel somewhat stereotypical. The romance between Gale and Dawn is also not fully fleshed out, and the resolution of their relationship feels rushed and unsatisfying.  
  
To improve the novel, I would suggest expanding on the relationships and motivations of the supporting characters, and deepening the romance between Gale and Dawn to make it more complex and realistic. Additionally, the ending could be revised to provide a more satisfying resolution for Gale and his friends.

Gale moves from Waterloo to Montreal because he thinks he will get nowhere if he stays in the same place. To him, his hometown represents his old life, his former way of being. Montreal, meanwhile, is a new and exciting land of dreams, the place where he met Dawn and danced [[with]] her on the deck of a summer dinner cruise.

To Gale, the woman he danced [[with]] was the most beautiful person he ever met. He never learned her name, or even heard her voice. All he remembered about her was hazel eyes, light brown shoulder length hair, and a pale blue dress that looked almost white in the dim light of twilight. They danced to "Nothing Broken But My Heart" by Celine Dion, a remarkable fact as the dance occurred on August 2, 1992 while the song's official release was on August 3, 1992.

Gale's relationship [[with]] Dawn distracts him from his writing, though through the experiences he gains confidence as [[an]] artist. He lacked things to write about, and through his experiences [[with]] Dawn he developed his own voice and started to manifest his will in the world.

Most notably, he had a group of three female friends in Waterloo who [[fit]] the roles of goddesses in his life. Tara Robles the architect replaces Eroica Vici the lawyer as [[Athena]] (wisdom and war). Selene Bauman the curator replaces Catherine Clement the engineer as Hera (duty and wrath). Charlotte Gagnon the doctor replaces Louise Charpentier the pianist as Aphrodite (beauty and mercy).

Gale's greatest challenge in Montreal is the pursuit of meaning. At first he pursues happiness via chasing the past (his fleeting relationship [[with]] Dawn), but meeting the architect at La Ronde kicked off a chain of events where he began questioning his own reasons for being in Montreal. Most notably, Tara's suggestion that he elope [[with]] her presents itself as [[an]] alternative to being with Dawn, as Gale and Tara were once high school sweethearts who broke up in their first year of engineering at the University of Waterloo.

Gale's relationship with Tara makes him waver in his intentions toward Dawn. He was also suspicious of why Dawn never showed up at La Ronde on the day of their date; it was by fluke that he happened to run into Tara, who was in Montreal with her classmates from architecture school.

Gale's pursuit of meaning manifests in his writing by beginning to reflect his own life more explicitly. The very text the reader is looking at is ostensibly Gale's own autobiography / [[journal]] / memoir. What ultimately helps him find meaning is realizing the subjectivity of all experience, notably through the realization that the Dawn he reunited with never existed except as a figment of his imagination. All that [[time]], he simply imagined a girl who looked exactly like the one who he did meet seven years ago.

Gale's new friends in Montreal [[fit]] the same archetypes as his friends in Waterloo. Gale's friends in Montreal are generally more nuanced or jaded versions of the archetypes from Waterloo. As [[an]] example: Tara is Eroica's cousin, and Eroica was the more dominant and crafty of the two. However, Tara has a special talent for never missing the mark, whether in shooting games, carnival ball tosses, or clever remarks. She also is the one who often foils Eroica's plans, through exercising her own will.

After Gale realizes that Dawn never existed, he had a period of idleness where both his friendships and his writing floundered. After finding out that Louise had died in a car accident on her way to the airport with the newborn child she had while Gale was gone, he is distraught by the loss of his fiancee and daughter. He drinks heavily, and accidentally falls into the water at [[Alexandra]] Basin in the Old [[Port]] of Montreal, the very place where he last saw the beautiful stranger seven years before when the ship docked back at the pier. Miraculously, the real version of Dawn, Sarah Carice Beaulieu, happened to be there when he well into the water, and saved his life.

Gale's relationship with Sarah ends in marriage. They have two children: Caroline Alice Jones, and Marie Eilish Jones. ([[Trivia]]: the latter grows up to become Ishmael, one of the leaders of a resistance movement in [[an]] alt-history future of Canada.)

Louise and the unborn child [[fit]] into the story via being [[an]] element of foreshadowing that Gale's actions have more consequences than he would like to admit. He thinks he can leave Waterloo and go back whenever he is done with his business in Montreal, but in reality there were many people who depended on him. He let down the original trio, and is denied the chance to truly make amends. All he can do is salvage the relationships he has with the new trio.

Gale imagines Dawn as a figment of his own imagination as a sort of self-delusion that gives him hope. He feels that his life is boring, and that he has never truly wanted for anything material. For him, the beautiful stranger he met seven years ago was a perfect enigma to carry with him forever. The fake version of Dawn first appeared after Canada Day; during a thunderstorm in the early morning of July 2, 1999, he said that he would finally go back to the Old [[Port]] of Montreal if the rain stopped before sunrise. It did, and so he went and gave himself hope in the way he knew [[best]]: lying to himself.

Montreal is used as a setting in which Gale is a stranger, and where he can make new connections and start anew. In reality, he is the same person no matter where he goes, and he himself realizes the parallels between the old trio and the new trio. He salvages the latter friendships only after the first three completely forsake him; Eroica and Catherine mourn the death of their dear friend Louise, and Louise the pianist is forever lost to death.

The Wind at Dawn is a coming-of-[[age]] story about a young man named Gale Jones who moves from his hometown of Waterloo, Ontario to Montreal, Quebec to pursue his dream of becoming a writer. The story is set in the 1990s, and centers around Gale's experiences in his new city, as well as his relationships with the people he meets there.

Gale is spurred in his artistic journey by a figure from his past, a young woman with whom he shared a dance when he was seventeen. He never learned her name, and only remembers her hazel eyes, light brown hair, and a pale blue dress. Through his apparent reunion with this mysterious woman, whom he calls "Dawn", Gale begins working at a [[café]] and meets a new group of friends who gradually replace the people he left behind in Waterloo.

However, Gale eventually realizes that the Dawn he reunited with never existed, and that she was simply a figment of his own imagination. This discovery is a turning point in his character development, and leads to a series of events that ultimately change the course of his life in Montreal.

Tara Robles is [[an]] architect who builds Sunview Heights, a new neighborhood in a fictional Waterloo. In the timeline of The Wind at Dawn, she is [[an]] ex-girlfriend of Gale Jones who re-enters his life when they meet by chance at La Ronde. He is dating David Hawthorn, but originally believed their relationship to not be so serious. During the period of upheaval in Gale's life when Dawn first disappeared, Tara became pregnant and decided to make her relationship with David work. She married him, and together they had Solomon. After Gale and Tara are back in contact, she names him as godfather to her Solomon Hawthorn.

Through his apparent reunion with this mysterious woman, whom he calls "Dawn", Gale begins working at a [[café]] and meets a new group of friends who gradually replace the people he left behind in Waterloo.

One of these new friends is Tara Robles, [[an]] architect who builds a new neighborhood in Waterloo. She was once [[an]] ex-girlfriend of Gale's, and they reunite in Montreal. Tara is pregnant with her husband David's child, and she names Gale as the godfather of their son, Solomon.

However, Gale eventually realizes that the Dawn he reunited with never existed, and that she was simply a figment of his own imagination. This discovery is a turning point in his character development, and leads to a series of events that ultimately change the course of his life in Montreal. For example, he discovers that his former fiancee Louise Charpentier, who was also a pianist, died in a car accident while he was in Montreal. He is devastated by this news, and falls into a period of heavy drinking and self-destructive behavior.

Ultimately, Gale's relationship with Sarah Carice Beaulieu, the real version of Dawn, leads to marriage and the birth of their two children: Caroline Alice Jones, and Marie Eilish Jones. The latter grows up to become Ishmael, one of the leaders of a resistance movement in [[an]] alt-history future of Canada.

The second of the new friends is Selene Bauman, a Chinese-German curator. She is the subject of Epistemology 1999, a short story set in the same universe as The Wind at Dawn. The text for it is below.

Epistemology 1999 is a short story set in the same universe as The Wind at Dawn. It is written in the first person, and follows the experiences of a young man named Gale Jones who is dating Selene Bauman, a Chinese-German curator. The story takes place in the fall of 1999, and focuses on the deepening relationship between Gale and Selene.

The story opens with Gale quitting his job at a [[café]], and spending [[time]] with Selene. They have conversations about various topics, and Selene's insights and questions inspire Gale to think more deeply about life and his own experiences. However, Selene's behavior becomes increasingly erratic, and she reveals to Gale that she is struggling with feelings of despair and hopelessness.

The story ends with a dramatic confrontation between Gale and Selene, in which Selene confesses her feelings and reveals her true appearance. The story leaves the outcome of their relationship open-ended, and does not provide any resolution.

The Wind at Dawn is structurally based on the art song of the same name by Edward Elgar and Caroline Alice Roberts, his wife. The lyrics comprise of eight couplets, and each couplet corresponds to one chapter in the story. Epistemology 1999 describes the events of the third chapter.

Additional info: Charlotte Gagnon the doctor is a regular at the [[café]] Génoise et Thé, and was secretly asked by Alain [[Tremblay]] the [[café]] owner to only speak to Gale in French. Gale only finds out much later on that Charlotte speaks perfect English, having went to Westmount High School. Charlotte becomes Gale's only remaining connection to the outside world after Selene's sudden departure and his subsequent hermitage, but becomes estranged from him when he becomes obsessed with finding Dawn.

The Wind at Dawn is a novel that follows the emotional journey of Gale Jones, a twenty-four year old man who moves from his hometown of Waterloo, Ontario to Montreal, Quebec in pursuit of his dream of becoming a writer. As he struggles to find his voice and develop his writing, he is distracted by a figure from his past, a young woman named Dawn with whom he shared a dance when he was seventeen.

Gale's pursuit of Dawn takes over his life, and he becomes increasingly obsessed with finding her and reconnecting with her. He is aided in his search by a new group of friends he meets in Montreal, including Selene Bauman, a Chinese-German curator, and Charlotte Gagnon, a doctor who becomes a regular at the [[café]] where Gale works. He also reconnects with Tara Robles, [[an]] architect who he dated in high school and his first year of university, when he was still [[an]] engineering student pursuing a so-called normal life.

As Gale's obsession with Dawn grows, he becomes increasingly isolated and distant from his friends and loved ones. His relationship with Selene becomes strained, and she eventually leaves Montreal without warning. Charlotte becomes his only remaining connection to the outside world, but she becomes estranged from him when he becomes too focused on finding Dawn.

Through his emotional journey, Gale learns the importance of connection and relationships, and ultimately realizes that his pursuit of Dawn was a delusion and that the woman he thought he knew never actually existed. He is forced to confront the consequences of his actions and the damage he has caused to his relationships, and must work to rebuild his life and reconnect with those he has pushed away.

In the end, Gale finds meaning and fulfillment in his relationships with those around him, and comes to understand the value of being present in the moment and living in the real world, rather than chasing after a fantasy. He is able to move on from his obsession with Dawn and begin to rebuild his life and relationships in a more meaningful and fulfilling way.

The true demonstration of his self-mastery is that he not only marries Sarah Carice, but also is able to consciously conjure up Dawn and speak to her as another part of himself. The part of him that wanted hope and nostalgia is forever tied to the image of a beautiful stranger in a pale blue dress and laceup heels.

The Wind at Dawn is a novel about the emotional journey of Gale Jones, a young man who moves from his hometown of Waterloo, Ontario to Montreal, Quebec in pursuit of his dream of becoming a writer. While there, he is drawn into a search for a young woman named Dawn, whom he danced with when he was seventeen.

As he becomes increasingly obsessed with finding Dawn, Gale alienates his friends and loved ones, including Selene Bauman, a Chinese-German curator, and Tara Robles, [[an]] architect and his ex-girlfriend. Charlotte Gagnon, a doctor who becomes a regular at the [[café]] where Gale works, becomes his only remaining connection to the outside world, but even she becomes estranged from him due to his obsession.

Ultimately, Gale realizes that his pursuit of Dawn was a delusion, and that the woman he thought he knew never actually existed. He must confront the consequences of his actions and work to rebuild his relationships and his life. In the end, Gale finds fulfillment and meaning in his connections with others, and learns the value of being present in the moment and living in the real world. He is able to move on from his obsession with Dawn and begin to build a new, more fulfilling life. Additionally, he is able to conjure up [[an]] image of Dawn and speak to her as another part of himself, demonstrating his self-mastery and ability to control his own thoughts and emotions.

Exactly where he last saw her, struggling new writer Gale Jones once again encounters the girl of his dreams. Or, rather, the beautiful stranger who haunts his restless slumber. She dons the same blue dress that she did on the fateful dinner cruise seven summers ago, when they shared a dance on the deck of the ship. The scent of her vanilla perfume and of her strawberry perfume is exactly as he recalls from when he held her close for six short minutes. Her smile, the precious sight granted to him mere moments before she disappeared into the night, is once more his alone to behold.

But she has apparently forgotten about that magical evening back in August 1992. Since the last [[time]] he came to the city, she lost all memories of her past. Now as listless as she is nameless, the young woman reveals little of her current life except that she always comes to the Old [[Port]] of Montreal at daybreak. And so there on early mornings Gale meets with his new friend “Dawn” to make good on their new promise: she will help him fall in love with the sunrise, and he will help her find her name. 

Madeleine biscuits with masala chai, classical music on cassettes and vinyls, fireworks during the festive summer months of the bilingual metropolis — from Canada Day to the New Year, the last six months of the old millennium mark their last chance to live in the hazy past. 

The Wind at Dawn is a work of literary magical realism that adopts the quaint nostalgia and yearning of Haruki Murakami’s South of the Border, West of the Sun and the heartfelt experimentation in form and medium of Keinart Lobre's One Thousand Lies.

The novel follows Gale as he navigates his relationship with Dawn and the challenges he faces in his personal and professional life. As he spends more [[time]] with her, he becomes increasingly obsessed with finding out her true identity and reconnecting with her. This pursuit becomes all-consuming, causing him to neglect his friendships and writing.

As his relationship with Selene becomes strained, she eventually leaves Montreal without warning. Charlotte becomes his only remaining connection to the outside world, but she becomes estranged from him when he becomes too focused on finding Dawn.

Ultimately, Gale realizes that the Dawn he has been pursuing is a figment of his own imagination and that the woman he thought he knew never actually existed. He is forced to confront the consequences of his actions and the damage he has caused to his relationships, and must work to rebuild his life and reconnect with those he has pushed away.

The Wind at Dawn is a story of self-discovery and the importance of connection and relationships. It explores the complexities of love and loss, and the power of the imagination to both bring us hope and lead us astray.

Each chapter also corresponds to a particular moment in Gale's emotional journey as he becomes increasingly obsessed with finding Dawn.

Gale is the one who named the beautiful stranger (or, at least, the illusion of her) Dawn. Their sunrise oath went as follows: she would help him love the sunrise, and he would help her find her name.

Dawn ostensibly had amnesia. In reality, Dawn is lying to him. This represents that Gale is lying to himself, as Dawn is a part of him.

In the sequel to The Wind at Dawn, Evil Days Redeemed, new characters and details are introduced. Quinine Clement, the daughter of Louise Charpentier and Gale Jones, is secretly raised by Catherine Clement. It is revealed that it was Catherine's child who died in the car crash, and she saw this as a command from God to take care of her [[best]] friend's child. Eroica is forced to help in Catherine's deception.

  

[[Hortus]] opens a [[café]] in Evil Days Redeemed called Génoise et Thé, named after the original [[café]] in Montreal. Alain [[Tremblay]] has passed away, and [[Hortus]] has strayed from the right path for a while.

  
  
  

Gale lived not a normal life. He lived the [[best]] of lives. He never appreciated his past life, because he was so happy he knew not even what there was to be thankful for. He felt unseen, but he was popular without knowing it. He realizes he threw his past life away with no regard for it.

  

Gale's father is the school principal, a former science teacher. Gale's mother is a writer and classicist. Eroica chooses Gale over his mother. Eroica schemed to get her and her friends closer to a popular kid, and the son of a famous writer. Catherine was rude to Gale out of jealousy, and Tara bullied her as revenge on Gale's behalf. Catherine saw that Gale was not like other popular people. Gale noticed not that Louise's English improved over the years, because he could afford to disregard people. Ancra thought of himself as Gale's sidekick. He tells Gale he could have protected Louise, and almost admitted the kiss.

  

Tara remade her image so they would be socially compatible. Before, she was not aware of popular people because she was so shut in. If he told her to, she would've stayed with him forever. She wanted to feel like she meant enough that he would stop her from leaving. He lived too well to realize how deeply someone can love. 

  

Catherine tells Gale to not tell Louise that Tara used to bully her in freshman year. She wanted not to bring up the past, or pit Louise against Tara.

  

Gale withdraws all his money, his personal savings, to give to Alain. Gale finds out he was hallucinating Dawn, and gives his money to Walking Eagle. Walking Eagle makes sure that the people from the [[café]] got the money, then disappeared. Him giving the [[Tremblay]] family Gale's money is what triggers the events of Christmas 1999.

  

When Gale leaves for Montreal, Louise's decision is to wait with the child inside her.

  

Gale and David talked about Tara without naming her. Gale describes [[an]] ex-girlfriend, David describes his current relationship. Gale gives David advice.

  

Tara knew that Gale knew. She and Catherine were already uneasy friends, and she was fond of Louise in [[an]] idolizing way. It hurt that the man and woman she loved most ended up together. 

  

Tara admits she sometimes thinks of Gale while with David. When she asks if she ever thought of her, she gets huffy when he says no.

  

Tara then says she never thought of anyone else with Gale, and asks him. He says he thought of Judy Garland for a brief moment during Fascinating Rhythm, and also of Audrey Hepburn. Tara is mad but can't express it.

  

Tara has seen David for two years, but is unsure of the next step. She offers Gale to elope together, if he chooses her over Louise. He is unsure, esp. as he has met David once. Catherine knew about them dating, but revealed it not and warned him to keep quiet, to keep the peace. She tells him to call her before her birthday on the winter solstice, as at twenty-four she shall move on.

  

Tara wanted to call him when she got pregnant, but had not his number (Eroica refused to help, wanting to keep the peace). She could not ask anyone for his number and she preferred it this way, so she can know Gale's answer to her question. This selfishness is something she regrets.

  

November 11: Gale sees Walking Eagle.

Thomas hurts Gale, so Gale denies Thomas.

  

"You know why my parents named me Thomas?"

"After Aquinas."

"Wrong. Doubting Thomas. The guy who stuck his finger in a hole on the Messiah's [[body]]." 

  
  

I took out my wallet and riffled through bills. In the end, I stuffed them all in his hands. "Will you manage?"

"I have to. Thanks." He took the money and spread it among his pockets. The eye of Elizabeth II stared through a hole. "Hey, can I use your shower? I'm kinda itchy."

"Maybe another [[time]]. Sorry."

  

(Gale gave Walking Eagle all the money he earned from Genoise et The and Selene.)

  

November 12: A shadow follows Gale. He calls for Charlotte, Selene, Tara, Catherine, Louise, and Dawn.

  

Gale calls Tara first, hanging up before she can explain anything (she says Thank God as her first words to him), and then calls Louise. Only after talking to Catherine (who knew about the elopement situation with Tara at La Ronde and his love for Dawn, after Gale calls out both those names on November 12) does he learn the truth, that Louise died, and was planning on giving their child to her father.

  

Tara explains that Eroica was somewhat in [[shock]] that things went not according to plan, and suggests that Gale call Ancra. "Help her, so she'll help you. She always has a way with problems, you know that!"

  

Eroica is revealed to be the shadow from November 12, dispatched by Catherine to investigate. In Gale's nightmares, the shadow is Louise haunting him.

  

He used up his once in a lifetime lie, so the lie he wanted --- that he is meant to be a great writer --- cannot be brought about. All he can write about is Dawn.

He never wrote anything of his full potential until he began to write about Dawn, about the painful memory of the ghost he loved.

  

In the Wind at Dawn, Gale Jones moves from Waterloo to Montreal to pursue his dream of becoming a writer. There, he reconnects with a woman he met seven years prior, who has no memory of her past. Gale names her Dawn and becomes obsessed with learning more about her. His pursuit of Dawn causes him to become isolated from his friends and loved ones, and ultimately, he realizes that Dawn was a figment of his imagination. After confronting the consequences of his actions and the damage he has caused in his relationships, he works to rebuild his life and reconnect with those he has pushed away. The novel is divided into eight chapters, corresponding to a couplet in the art song of the same name.

Dreams — there are two types of dreams. I dream of the wind and the sun, of Gale Jones and Dawn.

I present a story about dreams. This account is not a hypothetical, a fiction in the lines and spaces. I assert this as fact, though the lawyer and the engineer object: everything I say is true, or as good as true. 

  

June 21, 1999

On the last summer solstice of the twentieth century, Gale Jones was not the man he hoped to be. I know, for I was there, living inside his head, seeing the streets he walked in Montreal, feeling his urge to write and earn his name. I smoked a Belmont — inhale, hold, exhale — and crossed the street, heading back to a small un et demi in the McGill Ghetto. I typed on a Compaq til out of nicotine and inspiration, and brought a Walkman to bed at sunset. “Rewind”, “Play” — I fell asleep to [[an]] Elgar art song, and dreamed of [[an]] evening seven years ago.

  

August 2, 1992

On the last evening of a summer trip to Montreal, I shared a dance with the love of my dreams on the deck of a St. Lawrence River dinner cruise. I was seventeen, and she looked around my [[age]]. When the last slow song played — “Nothing Broken But My Heart” by Céline Dion — the wind blew past and led my eyes to her, fluttering her shoulder-length hair against her bare shoulders. The blue of her cocktail dress, pale as white in the waxing twilight, made her my Cinderella. I took a breathless step, and another. Face to face, I saw her eyes — they were hazel, the eyes of the beautiful stranger.

Wordlessly, we closed our distance. The wafting scents of shampoo and perfume sent a shiver down my spine. The delicate lady in lace-up heels kept her head down, and hid her flushed face in my neck. Anyone who saw us surely thought we were young lovers. I looked up at the lights of Montreal against the sky, and pulled her closer as the wind picked up. The chilly breeze, her warm [[body]] — how I froze from a graze, how I burned from a glance!

The music stopped, and the love of my dreams brought her face to mine, to plant a kiss or say a sweet nothing. Her lips chose neither as she stepped back and beamed a smile that said everything.

  
  
  

“A stranger called me last night,” I said. “Any idea who it was?”

“No,” she said, and watched the sunrise for two minutes, her hair dancing in the breeze of the early morning.

  

On Sunday, I was hired at a [[café]], the one I saw in Old Montreal. The next day at [[Alexandra]] Basin, I declared to the beautiful stranger: “I’m a barista at Génoise et Thé.”

“Is that so,” she said, not looking up from the scribbles in my old [[journal]].

“I’d come here anyway, is what I’m saying. The Old [[Port]] is the [[best]] place for reading before work.”

“Hard to read with your eyes staring up at me,” she replied with a smile. “Still on that page?”

My ears feeling hot, I went back to Le Silence de la mer. The next [[time]] I looked up, all there was next to me on the bench was my [[journal]], its pages flapping in the wind. Dawn was gone, and was not mine to find til the next day. When the [[time]] came, I left to go to work.

Our mornings passed one by one, six days a week. Sunday, the reminder of the lie I told Dawn, was a day of reflection and industry. I had less [[time]] to write than in the three months before, but the Word documents never looked better. The lawyer, sharp as ever, asked on the phone if something happened. I said everything was normal, and she pursued not the issue.

After three weeks of meetings at the Old [[Port]] and long days at the [[café]], I was no closer to fulfilling the promise between me and the beautiful stranger: she knew not her name, and I loved not the sunrise. Yet our sunrise oath persisted, fruitless as it was, coloring my mornings in the pale blue of the dress of the love of my dreams.

The fourth Friday of that July was the first [[time]] I broke our sunrise oath. As the laws of the universe dictated, everything spiraled out of control from the smallest disturbance.

Gale Jones works at Génoise et Thé. He only becomes a patron there when he becomes closer to Selene.
