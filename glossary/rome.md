Follow the [[yellow]] [[brick]] [[road]].

I [[found]] [[my]] [[old]] Bahaâ€™i texts. 
Opening [[them]] would remind [[me]] [[of]] [[her]], 
so I [[put]] [[them]] in [[my]] shrine [[for]] [[another]] [[day]].
[[Happy]] Easter. [[Today]], I was reborn.

[[This]] [[is]] [[nice]]. A walk in the mind's [[eye]].
[[Good]] way to [[clear]] thoughts.
