A [[word]] for a [[thought]], a [[language]] for a [[mind]]. No less than a [[complete]] corpus of literature [[is]] needed to shape a pseudoform of one personâ€™s inner story, the network of fact and fiction, of neat narratives [[with]] the corners tucked in and the wrinkles folded away. No more can a [[pantheon]] or a One True God show the expanse of experience, the multitude of man. The last person to have [[an]] identity written in the stars, at least the stars as [[we]] know them, [[is]] likely already born. [[Is]] he aware that he [[is]] the last of a kind, the final [[survivor]] of a great lineage?
