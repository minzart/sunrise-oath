What eyes have my eyes met in limpid passing, finding the flickering font of foreign fact and fiction in the soul of another, seeking from the [[outside]] what I lost within, yet gleaning no more than my image on the iris of the other I, the worldly wanderer in wilderness that I may never [[hope]] to see, trapped also in the prison of the mind in monolog, in endless back-and-forth between its parts, the hell of the soul in dialog, repeating one mantra til the end of [[time]]?  
  
Alone is the self, and selfish are the lone.  
  
No joy can I withstand before I fall, and come up with a new excuse to suffer, to choose the path of [[nature]] back to dust and clay, forsaking God and losing perfect [[grace]], meeting the morning star in mankind, rendered by the [[light]] of day in vivid image, the mirage that I have made my resting place. Why leave delusion when one chances on it? If the [[heart]] want [[truth]], and truly wants, what shows the [[story]] of a splendid lie, a beginning and end spun out by chattering hands that play the [[muse]] as though it were a toy, when it is cherished as the Way?  
  
Be the tree, the drinker of water, the eater of [[earth]], the bender of air, the taker of fire.  
  
Beauty and the Beast, Madonna and the Philistine, Mother and the Brute, Woman and the Man.
