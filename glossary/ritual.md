On Christmas morning, Gale burns a letter wishing to God for a miracle.

Catherine memorized plainchant version of rosary.

Selene sleeps at sunset with Gale and is gone before he [[wakes]]. (Also happens when he and Catherine camp)  
  
Selene is given a new name at twenty, same as how Catherine took Timothy's name at twenty.
