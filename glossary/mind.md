Augustine analyzes the [[nature]] of creation and of [[time]] as well as its relationship with God. He explores issues surrounding presentism. He considers that [[there]] are three kinds of [[time]] in the mind: the present with respect to things that are past, which is the memory; the present with respect to things that are present, which is contemplation; and the present with respect to things that are in the future, which is expectation.
