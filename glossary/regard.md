Gale's father is the school principal, a former [[science]] teacher. Gale's mother is a writer and classicist. Eroica chooses Gale over his mother. Eroica schemed to get her and her friends closer to a popular kid, and the son of a famous writer. Catherine was rude to Gale out of jealousy, and Tara bullied her as revenge on Gale's behalf. Catherine [[saw]] that Gale was not like [[other]] popular people. Gale noticed not that Louise's English improved over the years, because he [[could]] afford to disregard people. [[Ancra]] [[thought]] of himself as Gale's sidekick. He tells Gale he [[could]] [[have]] protected Louise, and almost admitted the kiss.
