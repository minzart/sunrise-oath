Multiplayer *Magic*, except turns are decided by a [[separate]] turn deck. GM plays [[without]] a deck, with as [[many]] player slots as needed.  
  
When a player loses the [[game]], they shuffle all cards they own in any zone back in their library, remove fifteen cards, and [[start]] from nothing. No mulligans.  
  
When a player causes a planeswalker to lose the [[game]] (GM or ally), they open a booster pack and put it in their hand. It becomes part of their deck.  
  
[[After]] the final boss, the last player to stand wins the [[campaign]].
