The Wind at Dawn is a novel about the emotional journey of Gale [[Jones]], a young man who [[moves]] from his hometown of Waterloo, Ontario to Montreal, [[Quebec]] in pursuit of his dream of becoming a writer. While [[there]], he is drawn [[into]] a search for a young woman [[named]] Dawn, [[whom]] he [[danced]] with when he was seventeen.

As he becomes increasingly [[obsessed]] with [[finding]] Dawn, Gale alienates his friends and [[loved]] ones, including Selene Bauman, a Chinese-German [[curator]], and Tara Robles, [[an]] architect and his ex-girlfriend. Charlotte Gagnon, a [[doctor]] who becomes a regular at the [[caf√©]] where Gale [[works]], becomes his [[only]] remaining connection to the [[outside]] world, but [[even]] she becomes estranged from him due to his obsession.

[[Ultimately]], Gale realizes that his pursuit of Dawn was a [[delusion]], and that the woman he [[thought]] he knew never [[actually]] [[existed]]. He [[must]] confront the [[consequences]] of his [[actions]] and work to rebuild his [[relationships]] and his life. In the [[end]], Gale finds fulfillment and [[meaning]] in his connections with others, and learns the [[value]] of [[being]] present in the [[moment]] and [[living]] in the [[real]] world. He is able to [[move]] on from his obsession with Dawn and begin to build a [[new]], more [[fulfilling]] life. Additionally, he is able to conjure up [[an]] image of Dawn and [[speak]] to her as [[another]] part of himself, demonstrating his [[self]]-[[mastery]] and ability to control his own thoughts and emotions.
