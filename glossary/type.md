Daydreams. Uncontrolled streams of consciousness that overwhelm us with self-evident facts and occult secrets. Dissociated from our immediate surroundings — whether due to boredom or stress or fatigue — we slip into a waking trance, letting our inner selves travel to grander places. Stories both retained in and created by our imaginations — stories both real and imagined — run their course in the theater of our minds, rescuing us from the present. Straddling between the unconscious and the conscious, we daydream while we take showers, walk to the grocery store, do the laundry, stare at a bright screen, work a part-time job, laze around in bed after not getting enough sleep. I would one day read on an online encyclopedia that half of our waking hours are spent on these daydreams, where all at once everything and nothing can be treated with the [[utmost]] [[importance]].
