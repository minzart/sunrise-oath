I.  
  
Mind is matter. Matter is mind.  
  
Psychosomatic pain and illness has a mechanical cause. All illness is mental, a matter of perception; and physical, a matter of physics.  
  
These people are experiencing real pain. Psychosomatic does not mean not painful. Psychosomatic illnesses are real illnesses. Interventions, as usual, can fix along physiological or psychological lines. Neither has primacy. Fundamentally, all physiological interventions attempt psychological [[results]], and all psychological interventions attempt physiological [[results]].  
  
Expanding on this idea, placebos are real medicine. Nocebos are real poison. They directly affect neurochemistry, and cause myriad physiological effects.  
  
Last step: prayers are real medicine. Curses are real poison.  
  
II.  
  
Question for your consideration: in what way is breaking an arm more of a "physical illness" than chronic Lyme disease? What if [[someone]] doesn't [[want]] their arm, and indeed would rather not [[have]] use of it? What if [[someone]] suffers in a state in which others would not?  
  
This is pertinent when speaking about dysphoria or dysmorphia.  
  
What makes an illness is the conscious negative perception of it, whether [[actually]] experienced or projected and personified by an [[outside]] party. In this way, two parties can reasonably disagree on what is an illness, based on the frame of their own values.  
  
For some people, [[having]] no stressors and no life threatening forces around them is in practice an illness.  
  
III.  
  
This section is a quick defense of my use of determinism, esp. as it relates to consciousness as a physiological / mechanical phenomenon.  
  
Necessarily, processes are either deterministic or random. Stochastic models, for example for bioelectricity, can still be describing deterministic phenomena; similarly, deterministic models can be describing random phenomena. My suspicion is that randomness is only a matter of ontological horizon, and there are [[ultimately]] deterministic causes for everything. This is a religious belief, in effect. I [[have]] no answer as to if the ultimate nature of the [[universe]] is deterministic or random, and it is out of the scope of this discussion.  
  
If there is in fact fundamental dualism in the [[universe]] that also allows for contrafactual free will, I suspect this may not be verifiable. [[Even]] in this [[situation]], a mechanical description is apt barring truly demonstrably out-of-context action.  
  
My point also stands with a usage in which [[something]] is "deterministic" if it is meaningfully modeled by an isomorphism, whether or not the nature of physics is in fact random. In the end, all experimental [[results]] are processed through consciousness and [[value]] hierarchies. "[[Close]] enough" or "sufficiently usable" is the ultimate standard, and this standard differs for the application and the applicant.
