[[Wisp]], [[breeze]], [[gale]].

Once upon a [[time]], I fell in love.  
  
August 2, 1992. She was around my [[age]], a year older or younger than seventeen. Thirty years ago, on the last [[night]] of a midsummer [[trip]] to Montreal, I saw her on a ship.  
  
I met the love of my [[dreams]] on the open-air deck of a summer dinner cruise.  
  
[[Dreams]], [[there]] are two types of [[dreams]]: waking [[dreams]], and sleeping [[dreams]]. Which [[one]] was she, that beautiful stranger? Til now, I had no clue. Yet in my middle [[age]], I cracked the code, and at last made sense of it all: the years of [[suffering]] as a writer, the restless nights of yearning.
