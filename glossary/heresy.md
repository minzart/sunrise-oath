“The followers of the prophet [[Jesus]] took his [[body]] from the tomb, whereupon the [[apostles]] met [[with]] them and [[saw]] that, indeed, their [[Lord]] was alive and [[well]], reborn as Christ in flesh [[into]] the multitude of men as perfection. Whereupon [[they]] raised him up to heaven, sending him [[through]] [[flame]] to his [[proper]] seat.”
