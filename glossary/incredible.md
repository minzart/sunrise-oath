“[[My]] [[days]] are [[all]] [[the]] [[same]]. Differences exist, but [[no]] specifics [[matter]]. [[Is]] it [[wrong]] [[to]] [[paint]] this [[in]] [[broad]] strokes?”

“That’s [[the]] [[only]] [[way]] it can be painted at all. It’s like you’ve [[lost]] your past over and over.”

“I [[suppose]] there’s no [[line]] [[between]] the past and the present. In the [[end]], the present becomes the past. Everyone loses their past when the present is meaningless, and meaningless [[things]] render my new life meaningless.”
