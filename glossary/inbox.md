Is it that I am bored, or that I am afraid? That I know not what to do, or that I know not how to do it?

I write, for there is nothing else to play.  
I think, for there is no one else to love.

I am living the privileged life of [[an]] aristocrat. I barely "work", outside my daily reading and writing, and teach piano a few times a week (on two grand pianos) for fun money. I pay no rent, and get served two keto meals a day. This made me feel guilty before. No longer.

The ceiling traps the wisps that yearns for sky and open air. A cigarette, yet [[burning]], bid the lips seek, the lungs take, the throat sigh. Humming, whether from the computer or the lights or the writer, drowns the chatter of the night, the endless noise outside the un et demi. Contract forbid his smoking, and so what? Not like the landlord ever came to check, nor had the will to stop the way he chose to live. Gale Jones was without duty, and vice versa; neither had stock in the other in the time and place that trapped them in their places.
