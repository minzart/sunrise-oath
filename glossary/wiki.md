The **history of wikis** began in 1994, when [Ward Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham "Ward Cunningham") gave the name "[WikiWikiWeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiWikiWeb "WikiWikiWeb")" to the knowledge base, which ran on his company's website at c2.com, and the [wiki software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_software "Wiki software") that powered it. The wiki went public in March 1995, the date used in anniversary celebrations of the wiki's origins. c2.com is thus the [[first]] true [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki "Wiki"), or a website with pages and links that can be easily edited via the [browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser"), with a reliable version history for each page. He chose "WikiWikiWeb" as the name based on his memories of the "[Wiki Wiki Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_Wiki_Shuttle "Wiki Wiki Shuttle")" at [Honolulu International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honolulu_International_Airport "Honolulu International Airport"), and because "wiki" is the [Hawaiian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_language "Hawaiian language") word for "quick".

Wiki software has some conceptual origins in the [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control "Version control") and [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext "Hypertext") systems used for documentation and software in the 1980s, and some actualized origins in the 1970s "Journal" feature of [NLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONLine_System "ONLine System"). Its distant ancestors include [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush "Vannevar Bush")'s proposed "[memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex "Memex")" system in 1945, the collaborative hypertext database [ZOG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZOG_(hypertext) "ZOG (hypertext)") in 1972, the [NoteCards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoteCards "NoteCards") system from [Xerox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox "Xerox"), the [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple,_Inc. "Apple, Inc.") hypertext system [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard "HyperCard"). As was typical of these earlier systems, Cunningham's motive was technical: to facilitate communication between software developers.

[[Many]] alternative wiki applications and websites appeared over the next five years. In the meantime, the [[first]] wiki, now known as "WardsWiki", evolved as features were added to the software and as the growing body of users developed a unique "wiki culture". By 2000, WardsWiki had developed a [[great]] deal of content [[outside]] its original stated purpose, which led to the spinoff of content into sister sites, most notably [MeatballWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeatballWiki "MeatballWiki").

The website [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia "Wikipedia"), a free content encyclopedia, was [launched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_wikis#2001%E2%80%932003:_Wikipedia's_early_years) in January 2001, and quickly became the most popular wiki, which it remains to this day. Its rise in popularity (it was in the top ten most popular sites in 2007 played a large part in introducing wikis to the [[general]] public. [[There]] now exist at least hundreds of thousands of wiki websites, and they have become increasingly prevalent in corporations and other organizations.
