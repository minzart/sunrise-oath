She saw in me the pains of growing up, the unflinching desire to suffer the right kind of pain, the [[stupidity]] to not see the futility of dwelling. On that night, in the office where she gave me a psychiatric evaluation, she told me I was a clever idiot. Within a few minutes of conversation, in which I invoked all manners of folk philosophy and literature having not yet pursued a serious practice of reading, I learned about her childhood (immigrated from Russia), [[heard]] of her love troubles (had a divorce with the love of her life), convinced her to hand me my phone (confiscated upon my [[confinement]] in the ward). It was then that I saw the other Catherine, the one that I was heartbroken over, had changed her profile picture and blocked me.
