[[The]] [[game]] roughly [[started]] [[out]] [[by]] agglutinating [[around]] artifacts ([[Black]] Lotus, Moxes) [[and]] [[twenty]] Lightning Bolt style [[play]], [[then]] [[settled]] [[around]] [[blue]] [[and]] artifact centric strategies, [[and]] [[in]] recent [[years]] [[has]] [[seen]] [[an]] explosion [[in]] [[the]] [[power]] [[of]] [[white]]. [[In]] [[the]] middle [[were]] various metagames dominated [[by]] [[black]] (Necro winter type of [[thing]]), red ([[burn]] or aggro), and green (Birthing Pod and Collected [[Company]]), but I think it's fair to [[say]] that Magic has often occupied the [[players]] in some [[broad]] [[strokes]] ways.
