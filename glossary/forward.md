Spellbound [[as]] [[I]] [[was]] [[on]] that evening [[in]] [[1992]], [[the]] magic died with the music. The crowd shuffled off the ship, and no thread of fate led me to the love of my dreams. The tour group lined up outside the charter bus, parked close by in the [[Old]] Port. As we boarded the bus, I saw someone along the metal [[barricade]] in front of the St. Lawrence River. From my window seat, I tried to find the [[beautiful]] stranger trailing behind a group of classmates or co-workers, looking at the waters. She was [[gone]], [[whisked]] [[away]] by the wind.
