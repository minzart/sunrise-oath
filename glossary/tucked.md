[[For]] [[the]] next [[three]] weeks, [[my]] [[days]] were [[long]]. [[Sunrise]] [[at]] [[the]] [[Old]] [[Port]], [[work]] hours [[at]] Génoise et Thé, sunset [[in]] [[my]] un et demi, and [[twilight]] [[in]] labored [[sleep]].

[[My]] [[writing]] [[was]] [[fruitless]]. [[Many]] [[words]] typed [[in]] [[the]] [[long]] [[Word]] file, [[not]] much [[said]]. [[I]] toiled [[at]] [[the]] keyboard and flipped [[through]] the books in my room, hoping for something to change. A [[welcome]] addition to my new routine was the [[coffee]] [[machine]] thrown out by a student in my [[building]]. I drank cup after cup, [[took]] stroll after stroll, smoked cigarette after cigarette. I was not [[satisfied]], not yet.
