[[The]] [[night]] [[of]] [[the]] football [[game]] [[was]] [[a]] wet [[dream]], [[a]] rosy [[fantasy]]. [[Tara]] [[was]] [[the]] [[same]] [[in]] math [[class]], [[as]] quiet and humble and bespectacled [[as]] [[I]] [[knew]] her. [[A]] month [[later]], [[I]] heard [[she]] [[was]] [[no]] longer [[on]] [[the]] cheerleading team, [[a]] fact that angered [[the]] seniors. [[They]] had [[a]] heated argument [[of]] sorts â€” rather, [[she]] listened [[to]] them [[with]] utter [[calm]], then [[left]] [[without]] [[a]] [[word]]. Her cheer [[career]] [[was]] [[over]], and [[she]] started taking [[the]] [[first]] bus [[after]] [[the]] bell. [[For]] [[the]] [[rest]] [[of]] [[the]] [[school]] year, [[we]] [[made]] [[no]] more than small talk about timetables, due dates, and course [[selection]].
