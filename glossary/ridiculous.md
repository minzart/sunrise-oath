When [[we]] take away [[execution]] luck, RNG luck, and [[yomi]] luck, [[we]] get a specimen which is purely based on strategy. Not [[even]] chess or Prismata get the honour of [[being]] a pure strategy [[game]] though (unless both [[players]] get a [[chance]] at [[white]] and [[black]]). Go or Reversi is closer to a pure strategy [[game]] than both of these, especially [[if]] the rule where [[one]] puts [[down]] two stones for [[black]] and [[one]] for [[white]] then the [[other]] player can pick the colour they [[want]] is used. [[Also]], the huge [[number]] of turns that [[need]] to be played in addition to pretty much [[absolute]] domination of inferior [[players]] by superior [[players]] ensures that the [[better]] player usually wins. (I can think of too [[many]] chess [[games]], in my own [[experience]] and in higher level [[games]], where "tactical vision luck" can bring [[someone]] from a slightly winning position to a strictly losing position in [[one]] or two moves.)
