For the rest of summer, I was under the spell of Selene Bauman’s [[blue]] almond eyes. After her tall frame and bleached hair, her eyes were the third trait I noted about her. She was in town for an exhibit at the Montreal Museum of [[Fine]] Arts — Cosmos, after the Romantic treatise of the same name.

“I advised the curatorial team on ‘Beyond the Earth: The Moon’,” she said as I served her on August 19.

“Your name checks out,” I said.

“Written like the [[goddess]], pronounced like the chanteuse.” She was [[pleased]]. “[[Autumn]] is [[coming]], and I [[am]] the [[autumn]] moon.”
