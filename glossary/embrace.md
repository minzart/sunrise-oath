[[After]] [[many]] lifetimes, [[someone]] excavates [[my]] plot [[and]] [[opens]] [[the]] [[vault]]. Disappointed [[in]] what he finds, he lets the rain fall through my sockets and ribcage. My skeleton ends up in a museum, in an exhibit beside the pianist. I wax poetic on laying with my beloved, but hear snickers: on the other side of her remains is the skeleton of a sleazebag from the hospice. How dare he? How could she? I rise to my feet — a hard task without neurons — and yell, “[[Go]] to hell, putain!” Outrage, that a skeleton speaks out of turn. A reporter [[holds]] out a microphone, and a child asks for an autograph. Bony [[arms]] crossed, I lie down and [[accept]] my role as a [[cuckold]]. Fin.
