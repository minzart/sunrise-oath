[[When]] I had found myself alone in the non-[[magical]] world, it had been through the [[help]] of those who knew Father that I made it. Among them had been those who saw me as a ticket to my family’s wealth. And, I am ashamed to [[say]], I fell for the ruses of many who [[sought]] to exploit my position as heiress. Though, even after I became more [[jaded]] in my views and more [[prudent]] in my interactions, I [[still]] could not avoid work relationships with opportunists. [[Such]] is life.
