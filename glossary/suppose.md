[[I]] [[heard]] her loud and [[clear]]. “It’s [[been]] [[nice]],” [[I]] [[said]], and walked [[off]].

“Where are [[you]] going?” [[A]] [[hand]] [[took]] hold [[of]] [[my]] arm, and [[I]] wrested [[away]]. [[She]] touched her spurned [[hand]] [[with]] [[the]] [[other]], and shrank [[away]]. “[[Why]] won’t [[you]] [[stay]]?”

Before [[the]] [[love]] [[of]] [[my]] [[dreams]], [[I]] [[was]] useless. “[[You]] think [[I]] [[believe]] [[your]] [[lies]]? [[I]] [[know]] [[we]] [[shared]] [[a]] [[dance]]. [[I]] [[know]] that [[seven]] [[years]] [[ago]], [[I]] fell [[in]] [[love]].” [[I]] [[said]] too [[much]], and [[was]] ashamed. “[[You]] [[remember]] [[me]], but [[wish]] [[you]] didn’t.”
