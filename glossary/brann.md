Brann [[is]] a tall, pale man [[with]] the [[body]] of a hungry peasant and the mind of a skilled tactician. A scar below his right [[eye]] comes from fighting enemies that took his parents from him. Since that difficult childhood, he has cared for himself and wandered the world [[outside]] of his [[native]] Byzantine Turkey. [[With]] few friends, he has made his name as a [[solo]] adventurer. He [[is]] always running from where he [[is]].

He meets [[Saad]] and the bartender at [[horn|Horn]] Tavern. Tasked by the latter to accost and detain the former, he ends up drugged by the degenerate man. Saad forces Brann to disclose his patron, then upon hearing the man's criticisms pays the adventurer to shut up.

A statue in Starhaven, that Brann names Garg (as he [[is]] a gargoyle), tells him of an auction for the unicorn horn that Saad sold away and wants back. At the auction house, following a scuffle [[with]] guards, a hooded man [[with]] a tattoo invites him to that [[night]]'s event and warns him by performing a powerful healing spell on him.
