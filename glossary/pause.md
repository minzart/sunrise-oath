Social [[Game]] [[with]] Index Cards  
  
1000 [[Blank]] Cards, [[with]] set rules for play priority.  
  
Cards are played by discarding cards and drawing them back. [[Players]] [[start]] [[with]] five cards. Any card may be played at any [[time]], though [[players]] take turns holding priority in clockwise order. Stack is last in, [[first]] out. Cards go to [[discard]] unless [[they]] [[have]] persistent effects.  
  
Cards that [[draw]] more cards are challenges. Cards that [[cost]] more cards affect [[other]] [[players]] in funny ways (and usually reward them).
