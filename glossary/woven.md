Gale is spurred in his artistic journey by a figure from his past, a young woman with [[whom]] he [[shared]] a [[dance]] when he was seventeen. He never learned her name, and [[only]] remembers her hazel eyes, [[light]] brown hair, and a pale blue dress. Through his apparent [[reunion]] with this mysterious woman, [[whom]] he calls "Dawn", Gale begins working at a [[caf√©]] and [[meets]] a new group of friends who gradually [[replace]] the people he [[left]] behind in [[Waterloo]].
