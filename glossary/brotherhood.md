Tension [[between]] [[my]] secular literary [[back]] log [[and]] [[my]] [[sacred]] [[exploration]].

Chipping [[away]] [[at]] [[both]], [[and]] [[seeing]] [[I]] [[was]] always meant to read everything exactly when I happen upon it.

No matter what, I have a story. This is true for [[everyone]], but the conscious knowledge of the power of fiction lets one choose heaven. 

[[Everyone]] knows someone who chooses [[hell]], and lives there full time. These people are miserable, and are doomed to suffer. Stay away [[from]] them and their life.

Here are two stories: in one, people exist with souls, each one more than the sum of the matter that generates it, and may be loved in their own right; in the other, humans are machines that act deterministically or randomly (must be one of the two!) and there is no need to believe in their intrinsic value.

Two more stories: in one, the World and God have minds, incomprehensible as they are, and not only have your best interests at heart but also want a relationship with you; in the other, all [[existence]] is indifferent or malicious, or is totally dead, and is a set of obstacles or levers along your path to self-fulfillment. Which story is better?
