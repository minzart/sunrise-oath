Long ago, I found an ancient trilobite in the shallows along a shore, past a waterfall running out to sea, the sights I never forgot. The arthropod was silent, and I thought of the vast wealth contained in its swollen gut.

As I reflected on how to kill it, a man in a coat [[with]] strange bulges came from the woods and approached me. His raccoon face was conspiratorial, and his lizard tail wagged.

“Care for a squirrel?” he asked, and a bird's talons emerged from between two buttons.

“I have no [[need]] for squirrels,” I said. “Only good luck.”

The talons disappeared, and another one offered a golden idol. “Free, for my future customer.”

He walked off, taking away my chance to protest.

Under a tree, my hand touched the idol, then my cuff. The spider wrapped on my wrist tapped against my pulse, as if to say: “New gear?”

“A waste of space,” I said.

“A use [[shall]] come,” it reassured without a word, and was dormant again.

Back in the island city where I once belonged, I thought of the lies I lived, the fears I learned. When did I lose them? At the side of a cliff, over a stepp drop in the desert. From then on, I was free. Or so I thought, til I looked into the eyes of the [[false]] god and saw nothing.

“You again.” The strange peddler waved, and hurried over. “Has your fortune changed?”

“No,” I lied.

“It will,” he said. “And when it does, you should pay me.”

“It was not free [[after]] all,” I sighed, and removed the spider from my cuff. “Take this.”

The man received the equipment in his claws and grinned [[with]] his furry face, beat the ground [[with]] his scaly appendage. I [[shall]] wait for him to meet his end on his travels, then wait for the cuff to be mine again. 

As he left, and was soon obscured by the shifting crowd, I regretted wishing for his death.

By a bog, a verse from the Book of Decay came back to me. Immediately, I felt the power of words—not of spirit, but of waste. Henceforth, [[there]] was no new knowledge. Only the old, imperfect ancients.
