[[In]] [[the]] dark heart of the Hidden Wood, beyond thick, tangled branches and thorns of sorrow, untouched and untroubled, in a clearing open to heaven, grows the Healing Tree. The primordial Source of the stream of Living Water springs from its roots! All these places are within you!

The fractured eye of man sees all illusion as commandment, and so the truth of ghosts must find its grave.
