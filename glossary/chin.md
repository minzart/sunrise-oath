The speaker seems to be affirming something that has just been said, possibly about being awake or the nature of reality. They also mention a drop of Perrier running down their chin and wiping it away, suggesting they may have been drinking the sparkling water. The use of "hiccuped" and "sniffed" implies that they may be feeling a bit unwell or emotional. Overall, the tone is somewhat dreamy and contemplative.
