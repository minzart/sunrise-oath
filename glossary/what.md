Gödel’s incompleteness theorems: [[no]] formal axiomatic [[system]] can [[be]] both [[complete]] [[and]] consistent. [[And]] so, unruly [[and]] unworthy [[humanity]] — [[with]] or [[without]] [[God]] — [[is]] [[stuck]] being either powerless or irrational. Who was I, to yearn for a scientific future? Who was I, to choose which way to pull the lever? And who am I now, to despair over a [[magical]] past now lost? But what is the past, and what is the future? Even if they exist outside [[imagination]], how can we hope to [[move]] either way? So many [[years]] to my life were devoted to unknowable truths, to unsolvable [[problems]].
