Ã‡a fait longtemps :) As I progressed in [[my]] reflections, I [[saw]] that I was avoiding [[writing]] to you or your [[parents]] out of a [[fear]] of imposition. But I [[am]] in [[an]] imposing mood, [[so]] a funny [[secret]] I [[want]] to [[get]] [[off]] [[my]] [[chest]] [[is]] that I often [[write]] stories [[with]] your [[parents]] in mind! [[So]] [[many]] of the characters I create [[are]] taken [[from]] [[one]] [[short]] summer [[stay]]. [[We]] [[never]] [[got]] to [[speak]] [[one]] on [[one]], [[so]] I [[never]] [[got]] to [[say]] that your [[parents]] [[were]] [[my]] [[awakening]] to [[seeing]] [[how]] [[things]] [[could]] be in a family. I [[am]] sure nothing [[is]] [[ever]] [[perfect]], but [[when]] I was seventeen the experience of [[living]] in your childhood home on 29e avenue [[gave]] [[me]] the bravery to [[ask]] more [[from]] life. The generosity and compassion your family showed [[me]], and its [[place]] in [[my]] small mental [[universe]], [[shall]] [[stay]] [[with]] [[me]] to the [[end]] of [[my]] days. I [[wonder]], [[how]] [[have]] you and your [[parents]] [[been]]? I recall that Sylvie [[went]] [[up]] north, but [[have]] no [[further]] knowledge of your family's [[story]] [[after]] that.
