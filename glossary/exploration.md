[[The]] promised [[kingdom]], [[standing]] [[in]] [[the]] [[land]] [[of]] [[dreams]], [[took]] [[me]] [[as]] [[a]] [[hostage]]. [[My]] [[first]] [[foray]] to heaven, where hardship was not known to any soul, showed me how deep was the well of suffering. I only breached the surface of the water, and for all I cared I broke through to paradise.
