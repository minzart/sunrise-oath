She shines like a star, 
While I'm unnoticed, lost in a maze.

For over a year, I've watched her grace, 
From a distance, captivated by her presence, day and night. 
Words escape me, leaving me in a frozen space. 
Though I yearn to speak, to express my desire, 
Fear takes hold, extinguishing the fire.

She sips black coffee every day, a ritual embraced, 
Fueling her endeavors with its bitter taste. 
Hardworking, diligent, she never rests, 
In the library's haven, she conquers her quests.

During study breaks, she finds solace in smoke, 
Cigarettes intertwining with dreams she invokes.

A scent divine, as she passes me by, 
A fusion of apple and vanilla, I sigh.

Expressionless, she may seem cold, 
But her little smiles illuminate my world.

Her gentle brown hair, cascading down her collarbone, 
A touchable length, enchanting on its own. 
Though stoic at times, her smile reveals, 
A radiance that the world so dearly feels.

I long to speak, to bridge the divide, 
But from afar, my affections I hide.

I wonder, what burdens does she bear? 
She seems weary, a weight she cannot share.

If only she knew, together we'd be strong, 
Facing the world, where nothing could go wrong. 
No more fear on her midnight walk, 
For I'd be her [[guardian]], her comforting rock.
