[[Typing]], [[typing]], [[typing]] . . . Twitter is a roguelike. The object is to create wonderful connections [[between]] [[words]], almost like semantic matchmaking. [[Each]] [[word]] has a fated polycule, or at [[least]] a [[nice]] romp or a [[good]] ol’ orgy [[fuck]]. Melding in ways no [[one]] would [[have]] [[thought]] [[possible]], had it not appeared before them in [[proper]] syntactic form, these [[building]] blocks of [[meaning]] [[share]] a brotherhood that [[only]] the dispossessed can [[ever]] [[know]]. Manipulated on a [[page]] however the [[author]] ordains, ideas find themselves in the course of his wanton [[play]]. Yes, it is not the [[duty]] of a player to create [[an]] [[idea]], to [[birth]] a [[revelation]]; rather, the [[game]] is all about bringing to the spotlight those finite souls that mankind [[will]] [[ever]] [[allow]] to haunt its mind. No greater [[cause]] is [[there]] [[than]] the fostering of a pitiable orphan, a train of [[thought]] derailed and stranded in [[an]] Arizona [[desert]] (though the writer of this [[paragraph]] has never [[even]] [[seen]] a cactus for himself), for any child [[could]] be the [[future]] of the world, [[through]] iron letters or [[paper]] [[force]].

[[If]] Twitter is de facto marketplace of [[new]] and fresh ideas, then I [[am]] [[glad]] that Elon [[took]] control. [[From]] using it a lot these past few weeks, I [[feel]] my [[brain]] is working better [[than]] before. The scan of [[words]] in [[English]] on a [[page]] or screen fire neurons I [[forgot]] I [[ever]] [[used]].  
  
The poasters are my [[favorite]] [[company]], providing controversy, scandal, and revolution in my staid intellectual life. I [[started]] [[reading]] literary magazines this past [[year]], and [[have]] a neoliberal [[esthetic]] LARP atop the anarchist that I [[am]]. To [[know]] the enemy is to see [[victory]], [[maybe]]; to see [[only]] the enemy is to [[know]] [[only]] war. Pleasant [[writing]] is not a luxury, but a [[must]]. The Bird App is a town square, not truly public (see the negative tweets about the CEO that were censored) but better [[than]] anything [[we]] [[have]] or [[ever]] had.  
  
Art and [[action]] [[start]] and [[end]] with the [[actual]]. A [[painting]] shows [[existence]] yet itself [[exists]], a loop that [[finds]] its fans with those who finished Gödel, Escher, Bach.  
  
The [[sun]] [[set]] over his dying [[body]]. By [[dusk]], he was [[gone]].

[[Writing]] is meditation.  
  
A single [[paragraph]] in my control, a [[space]] to [[put]] [[together]] thoughts and polish them as Raphael brushed [[off]] his [[early]] studies. [[Standing]] in a [[church]] of Christ and Rome, he [[formed]] a [[new]] myth for a golden continent.  
  
What might [[have]] [[been]] [[an]] [[act]] of blasphemy, to graft the pagan gods to saints and prophets, is [[now]] [[seen]] as a sky of clouds. Puffs of [[white]] in lightly floating [[blue]], backgrounds in the lives of men who [[long]] [[forgot]] to see the [[joy]] and [[beauty]] filling everything. A blasphemy is [[soon]] theology for [[new]] religions.  
  
[[An]] [[artist]] is a [[patient]] of inspiration, a [[student]] of the [[divine]], a follower of the way. No greater right [[exists]] [[than]] [[exploration]] of what the mind of all mankind contructs, its clouded concrete complex fixed in a [[space]] [[between]] wake and sleep. The thoughts [[we]] [[have]] [[together]] are what the [[consciousness]] of all mankind [[shall]] see when he is [[sitting]] in a closet, attacking djinns and dragons in his mind, wondering [[why]] it [[took]] so [[long]] to see his frailty and mortality.

Manifest destiny,  
and you [[shall]] walk the [[path]] for you [[alone]].  
A thousand [[years]] [[through]] [[cosmic]] void,  
the [[light]] of giants pierce the wine-[[dark]] sea.  
  
A woodland [[bound]] by creeping artifice.  
I [[went]] to the grave where [[we]] last [[met]],  
and waited [[there]] for three days and three nights.  
  
On the third [[night]], she [[came]] to [[me]] and whispered  
in a voice I [[thought]] I [[long]] [[forgot]]:  
Once more, I love you. It has [[been]] too [[long]].  
  
My [[mentor]] in the arts of love and [[duty]],  
judging [[me]] by her stiff criterion, gave her [[verdict]],  
[[spoke]] the [[truth]] she knew: guilty.  
She [[kissed]] [[me]], and condemned [[me]].  
  
The [[years]] go by, and she makes no more mention  
of what [[we]] hoped to make [[forgotten]].  
Her [[curse]] persists, insists, and I [[resist]].  
[[Futility]], and [[vanity]], and pride.  
  
I [[wonder]] [[if]] she [[knows]] her wanton spell  
[[broke]] everything I knew when I was [[young]].  
  
Everything is air.  
Air is nothing.

Just think, [[how]] easy would it be to [[frame]] the world as art to little kids? The followers of [[holy]] texts all [[know]] this, and tell [[old]] mythologies of Him, the [[perfect]] [[being]], to their [[children]]. [[Why]] [[have]] the authors of the godless texts not harnessed what the Abrahams [[have]] [[mastered]]?  
  
A [[sage]] [[aligned]] [[against]] the mortals [[may]] [[seek]] to [[bring]] about his paradise, and fence the world to [[keep]] it in his [[palm]]. [[We]] [[fear]] the minds that [[may]] arise and [[break]] the balance of all [[things]], and yet the artificial brains of crowds has [[been]] the bodies of the greatest men.  
  
The [[wisp]] is to smoke what the person is to [[dust]].
