At Génoise et Thé, we held an emergency meeting. Presiding over the session, Juniper announced: “We can’t lose this [[café]]. There’s too much at stake.”  
“There comes a point where the cost is too high,” Collis said. “Should we set a figure?”  
Franklin pulled out a laptop. “I can do a utility estimation.”  
“No,” I said. “Let’s do this: whoever wants to opt out may do so at any point.”  
Everyone exchanged glances, nodding. And so, my suggestion was put in place.
