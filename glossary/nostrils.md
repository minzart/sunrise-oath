[[As]] soon [[as]] [[I]] arrived [[in]] Bern [[the]] next [[day]], [[I]] [[made]] a detour en route to my destination — the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual [[Property]] where Einstein worked as a patent clerk — and found a print shop. A blonde Swiss girl [[helped]] me package and ship a single [[high]]-quality print of the [[photograph]] to my apartment in America. As much as I wanted for someone [[else]] to appreciate the [[weight]] of that image, the bubbly employee humming to herself would not [[understand]]. Also, the guys back at the laboratory would [[give]] me an earful if they found out I was disclosing [[confidential]] information.
