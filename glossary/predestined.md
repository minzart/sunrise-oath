[[I]] [[was]] [[meant]] [[to]] [[write]] [[these]] [[words]] right now, at this time and place. 12:22pm—no, 12:23pm—on the twenty-eight [[day]] of April in the year 2023. As I ate my lunch, a small feast of meat and eggs, a thought came to mind: what has God intended me to do after I [[finish]] eating? And why has God have me think now about what he intends? So on, so forth. (The tangled loop, as described by Douglas Hofstadter in his work.) I was [[convinced]], by the time I washed my plate and came upstairs, that I was to [[write]] these words and send them to whoever comes to mind, so that they may see me, and God, as we are.
