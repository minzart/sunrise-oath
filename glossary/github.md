I’m [[terrible]] at version control. Either I don’t bother committing for months on [[end]], or I do it [[every]] five minutes. [[If]] [[there]] were a way of [[doing]] this whole [[enterprise]] that was [[much]] more transparent, I’d prefer that. (Though it’s [[good]] that GitHub hosting this site means that I [[am]] idiot-proofed [[against]] accidentally uploading all my [[private]] keys or [[something]].)
