(The following is an old Facebook post I found while scouring my Facebook for local RPG playgroups.)

December 23rd, 2014 to January 1st, 2015 is ten days. Since I would otherwise be wasting away at home practicing piano, I will try to do some writing on each of these ten days. The first nine days will be self-reflections, and the tenth, on New Year's Day, will look forward. This will be Post 2/10.

I have always had a fascination with "pure strategy games".

Games like chess, which I have played extensively over the past year, and Lunarch Studio's new Prismata, are prime examples of this.

For the sake of this post, I will also consider piano a "pure strategy game". My justification for this is that musical shaping is very "strategic" by [[nature]]. The key in music is contrast. Planning out your execution for the entirety of a piece requires quite a bit of foresight, just like in other "pure strategy games".

For games like Call of Duty, there are many many factors outside of strategy. Execution luck is one such factor. Even if you planned out the perfect strategy with your perfect game insight, missing a crucial headshot or screwing up a grenade can often just make you lose. For piano, there is a similar aspect, but muscle memory is much more controlled and straightforward in piano than in Call of Duty. Basically, execution luck keeps players on their toes: even if you are understanding the game and using the perfect decision for the situation, there is still the element of "not screwing up".

I studied poker a lot after I had a small interest in it. This is in many ways the ultimate "strategy game", since it is an example of a game where the better players usually come out on top. Playing 1000 chess games against your friend is unreasonable and exhausting, but playing 1000 poker hands is much more straightforward. However, there is an element that makes this game strangely frustrating to learn (since learning requires short-term feedback as reinforcement): RNG. You can calculate that based on your opponent's perceived tightness with their hands, their odds of ripping a full house on the river to beat your straight is only 4%, and so you can safely bet (or even raise). However, 1 in 25 games with this situation you will get utterly screwed when their out does come down. Most situations are not this extreme and instead have smaller "odds advantages". Imagine learning poker when you are making appropriate decisions, but you are pretty much being repeatedly punished for them. Losing money on losses also limits the amount of "education" a person can afford before the game just becomes too expensive.

Imagine a game like rock paper scissors. Tell me, which is the best sign? This is a ridiculous question, because no hand in this game has an advantage. But then, how is it that certain signs beat other signs? The results of who wins and who loses comes down to a showdown. This kind of "matchup luck" is more commonly called yomi luck. A less extreme example of yomi luck is Starcraft, or any other real-time strategy game. Many strategies fall flat on their back if the opponent, in the safety of the "fog of war" (limited vision), happened to pick a countering strategy. Of course, in Starcraft you can play "gambits" where you sacrifice a worker to scout the opponent's base. But yomi luck is nevertheless a huge part of Starcraft, which is actually considered a quite luckless game. League of Legends also has the element of yomi luck, in that some of the best champions often have a disgusting counter that is otherwise not too viable, and that by [[nature]] makes that counter a viable champion. Weird metagame stuff. Magic: the Gathering is probably the greatest example of a game dominated by yomi luck, not only in deck matchups but also in calculations of play lines where you can instantly lose if the opponent is holding a certain card and you have to play around these "mind games". (In piano, I can argue that yomi luck comes into effect in competitions where playing certain pieces in contrast to certain opponent pieces gives you a slight advantage in adjudication, but this is very convoluted.)

When we take away execution luck, RNG luck, and yomi luck, we get a specimen which is purely based on strategy. Not even chess or Prismata get the honour of being a pure strategy game though (unless both players get a chance at white and black). Go or Reversi is closer to a pure strategy game than both of these, especially if the rule where one puts down two stones for black and one for white then the other player can pick the colour they want is used. Also, the huge number of turns that need to be played in addition to pretty much absolute domination of inferior players by superior players ensures that the better player usually wins. (I can think of too many chess games, in my own experience and in higher level games, where "tactical vision luck" can bring someone from a slightly winning position to a strictly losing position in one or two moves.)

"But why are you telling me all of this bullshit, Tim?"

Good question, class.

Have you ever wished you were born into a better situation? I know I have. Imagine being rich as fuck and living inside a perfectly functional and 100% supportive family that also managed to foster a very strong sense of morality. Also, being born hot as absolute fuck and turning heads just by existing.

Of course, I can't decide this sort of thing. In fact, I can consider myself "lucky" I wasn't born in some impoverished country and dead before my third birthday because of malaria or AIDS (or EBOLA KEKEKEKEKEK :kappa:). This is in some way life's "yomi luck". We are born a certain way and have to face life and other people with the skill order, class, and equipment we were given at birth.

Name: Tim Min

Life is a shitty RPG. Perfect.

Now, think about some critical crossroads throughout your life. Maybe there was one really crucial argument with a friend, one decision about which high school you go to that you have to make, one really important essay to write for a university application.

Hey look, execution luck has a role! You have to not only know what to do, but also do it right. I think everyone has screwed up at least once in their life.

Now, imagine sitting around in an office working your shitty job, when suddenly you have the urge to check the lotto numbers for next week, and lo and behold you just won $13 million.

This is a super fringe case of RNG luck. A better example would be being lab partners with a future CEO of some huge tech company and using that connection to land a high-paying management job, or meeting your future spouse after you fell out of a tree saving a cat.

When you think about how much luck is integrated into your life, it raises the question: Do you "deserve" more or less success, based on your various strategic decisions? Imagine getting a divorce with your spouse of 15 years because they are irritable. Turns out, they just had a benign tumour in their brain, which they had taken out after he suddenly inherited a long lost relative's huge company. They revert back to the person you fell in love with, get married with someone strictly better than you, and leave you in your room crying while binging on misordered anchovy pizza.

In this situation, you made a completely reasonable and in fact correct decision; however, somehow life manages to punish you for it.

When I play piano, everything starts as nothing and ends as nothing. I have ultimate control over the keys. The audience is under the spell cast by my fingers. I control time, I control mood, I control the message. Absolute control. Something achievable in everyday life.

Bruce Pandolfini, famously portrayed by Ben Kingsley in "Searching for Bobby Fischer", wrote these words:

"Playing chess gives us a chance to start out life over again, and this time, no one has more money than us, no one is more beautiful, no one lives in a better neighborhood, and we all go to the same school. Other than having the first move (and this benefit is shared equally) no one starts with any unfair advantage."

[â€“ Bruce Pandolfini, 2000]

I think this is enough to show why I have such a fascination for "perfect strategy games".

Yet another day of morning ramblings. Today, I reflected on my escape from reality through games. It might be interesting if other people also reflect on this aspect for themselves too, because then they might understand or sympathize with the sentiments I expressed.
