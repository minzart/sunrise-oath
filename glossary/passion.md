[[Primo]] [[is]] alarmed [[to]] [[learn]] [[that]] [[Lea]] [[is]] [[a]] [[woman]]. [[He]] refuses her [[as]] [[she]] [[is]] drunk, [[and]] resolves [[to]] [[enter]] eight [[days]] [[of]] reclusive meditation [[to]] strengthen his resolve before their [[future]] travels. His exploration of Crowley and the occult [[results]] in their confrontation [[with]] the conjured crimson vampire Alcazar, who curses them to [[fear]] for the loss of the [[other]]. [[Feeling]] [[pity]] [[after]] [[seeing]] their plight, he [[also]] blesses them [[with]] the greatest doctrine, contained in a potion that he gifts to them. He [[assures]] them that [[they]] [[shall]] be guaranteed fame or eternal life, but not both.
