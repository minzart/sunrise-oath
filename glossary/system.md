**I hope other players may be inspired by this design, and incorporate it into other games. I had an idea of combining Duality and Magic, giving a randomized hexagon diagram to creatures with power/toughness and rules text. (Use a custom card editor, use a Duality diagram as the card art, and alter the rules of combat however you see fit.)**

This is it. All I have to do is create infrastructure for my words to live in. This is a museum of all the thoughts I have. All I have to do is curate them, and place them beautifully.

Organization is art in and of itself. I hope someone sees this.
