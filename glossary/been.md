[[On]] [[my]] [[deathbed]], [[I]] hold [[the]] [[pianist]]â€™s [[hand]]. [[At]] [[the]] funeral, [[the]] [[engineer]] [[and]] [[the]] [[lawyer]] [[give]] [[my]] corpse [[a]] [[lifetime]] service award. My casket drops in a vault, and the vault plunges in a six-foot [[abyss]]. I scream for someone to dig me out, rip off my starched shirt, and warm me with an [[embrace]].
