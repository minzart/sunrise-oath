[[This]] has [[to]] [[work]], [[I]] [[thought]]. It just has [[to]]. But [[after]] spreading out [[the]] instant [[film]] [[on]] [[the]] dining [[table]], [[I]] [[could]] [[only]] [[laugh]] [[to]] stave [[off]] [[the]] incoming sobs. [[In]] those half-developed pictures, there were not only no hints regarding my [[parents]], but no traces of any magic whatsoever. No signs of alchemical experiments in Father’s study, of culinary [[sorcery]] in Mother’s kitchen, nor of beginners’ charms practice in my bedroom. It was as if the magic of the past had been overwritten or sealed away, hidden from my scientific eye set on concrete answers. In those [[still]] images, we were just a normal family: Father chatted with his friends, Mother served dinner to the guests, I [[ran]] around the [[garden]] under Greg’s watchful eye.
