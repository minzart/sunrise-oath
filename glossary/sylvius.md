That asshole [[ought]] to teach the damned bird how to run the register, [[Hythar]] thought as he hurried into the back. He could crack the [[safe]] and make everything square. It was only fair, after so long. Finding the combination on a slip of paper was a cinch, and as he turned the knob he was sure that five minutes later he would surely be back in the market district, finding something fun to do for the rest of the [[afternoon]]. Maybe a trip to Hademarâ€™s? That new quill of his was the talk of the town.
