Lea Artemis [[is]] a devoted follower of [[christ|Christ]], who pretends to be a man and fights for her God. Swearing an oath to [[Saint]] Nicholas, she leaves the Crusades behind and travels eastward in search of new knowledge. Weak in flesh, yet strong in the Word, she holds the sword as an icon of divine favor.

Lea comes across the writings of Han Fei, the Chinese legalist scholar. He teaches that the law [[is]] written in the soul, and that a person can only obey the law if they understand it. 

[[After]] the death of her parents, she came under the care of a Church elder. In her youth, she grew up to be a strong and self-sufficient child. She feels she must take charge of her life and make her own decisions. She knows her parents died fighting for the church, but they weren't happy doing so, and she has felt their loss ever since.

Lea Artemis takes up the sword and learns the Word. She [[is]] in a daze. A dream, a nightmare, she doesn't know which. She stands [[with]] her sword in hand, staring at a young man. His lips move silently.

Lea stands [[there]], transfixed. She can't move. She has to move. She moves toward the young man. She gets close, and his voice cuts through her, piercing the fog in her mind. "Do not seek the [[truth]]," he says. "You will [[die]]."

“You are the snake,” she realizes.

The young man, the snake, says to Lea, “Fear not knowledge. You [[shall]] escape the great lie.”

Lea is terrified, but she tries to slash at the snake man. The sword cuts right through his chest, right through the heart. The snake man is not dead. She strikes him over and over til she wakes up.

Lea awakes to the sounds of church bells. She is in a small town by a river. She hears a child crying. She looks at the ground and [[sees]] a bloody sword. She continues her studies under the Church elder, despite the seeds of doubt that have sprouted in her heart.

In a field, she meets a group of pagan cultists, who challenge the righteousness of her Lord. Insulted, she engages them in combat. In a close fight, she defeats the heathens and learns of a [[scroll]] that holds [[sacred]] [[truth]], hidden in a [[lost]] [[domain]] of [[earthly]] [[wealth]]. 

Needing to know more, she heads to a beer hall in the nearby village of [[starhaven|Starhaven]], a bastion of [[sin]] and indulgence. [[There]], she meets a wealthy heretic follower of Simon Magnus, who performs feats of magic that she cannot deny. He says quotes from Confucius and Lao Tzu, distant sages who she has never heard of, then quotes Calvin, Hobbes, and *Calvin & Hobbes*. 

Suspicious of him, yet seeking allies on her quest, she asks him to join her. He agrees, on the condition that they renounce the bounty of the world in a joint oath. As they complete a pact through the exchange of earthen rings hardened by flame, the [[morningstar|Morningstar]] dawns on them. From this moment on, Lea hears the voice of the Prince of Darkness, the fallen [[angel]] [[lucifer|Lucifer]]. It tells her of a phoenix whose song [[shall]] bring the end of her times and usher in a new era.

The wayward mage, Primo, tells Lea of the goddess [[guanyin|Guanyin]], whose love and mercy saved the other side of the world. Lea holds the Virgin [[mary|Mary]] as the greatest image of a woman, yet is moved by the projection of her that her new friend conjures up. She tries to refute her [[message]], yet is unable. This is her first doubt, and leads to her being receptive to Lucifer's suggestion that they consult an oracle at the shrine of an abandoned city's castle on a hill. 

Primo teaches her about Zhang Guo, who gained knowledge through wine. She resolves to forgo food and use her fast to mediatate through drink. In her drunken state, she has her second doubt on God, seeing that the mechanics of her mind led her to the thoughts and experiences she has, and that the same goes for God. She is disturbed by her increasing romantic interest in Primo, whose path away from the world's riches mirrors her own, whose silvery charm and tantalizing passion made her [[question]] the moral laws she saw as inviolable. 

Primo is alarmed to learn that Lea is a woman. He refuses her as she is drunk, and resolves to enter eight days of reclusive meditation to strengthen his resolve before their future travels. His exploration of Crowley and the occult results in their confrontation [[with]] the conjured crimson vampire Alcazar, who curses them to fear for the loss of the other. Feeling pity [[after]] seeing their plight, he also blesses them [[with]] the greatest doctrine, contained in a potion that he gifts to them. He assures them that they [[shall]] be guaranteed fame or eternal life, but not both.

In a forest, an imp of [[wind]] and frost tempts Lea and Simon [[with]] [[false]] riches and tainted scripture, and traps them in a labyrinth. Convinced that she is burning in hell, Lea takes off her armor and wanders the storm naked. She falls in a river, and is severely frostbitten. Her third doubt, presented in the form of the serpent, is in the power of oath and convenant itself. She removes the earthen ring and takes a new talisman from a mermaid who saves her. Primo finds her, but she is empty. Her greatest strength, the Word, was lost to her in the lake. She could no longer speak. Her birthright as a knight, as a conqueror of evildoers, was taken from her.
