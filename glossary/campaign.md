Lea Artemis [[is]] a devoted follower of [[christ|Christ]], who pretends to be a man and fights for her God. Swearing an oath to [[Saint]] Nicholas, she leaves the Crusades behind and travels eastward in search of new knowledge. Weak in flesh, yet strong in the Word, she holds the sword as an icon of divine favor.

Lea comes across the writings of Han Fei, the Chinese legalist scholar. He teaches that the law [[is]] written in the soul, and that a person can only obey the law if [[they]] understand it. 

[[After]] the death of her parents, she came under the care of a Church elder. In her youth, she grew up to be a strong and self-sufficient child. She feels she must take charge of her life and make her own decisions. She knows her parents died fighting for the church, but [[they]] weren't happy doing so, and she has felt their loss ever since.

Lea Artemis takes up the sword and learns the Word. She [[is]] in a daze. A dream, a nightmare, she doesn't know which. She stands [[with]] her sword in hand, staring at a [[young]] man. His lips move silently.

Lea stands [[there]], transfixed. She can't move. She has to move. She moves toward the [[young]] man. She gets close, and his voice cuts through her, piercing the fog in her mind. "Do not seek the [[truth]]," he says. "You will [[die]]."

“You are the snake,” she realizes.

[[The]] [[young]] [[man]], the [[snake]], says to [[Lea]], “[[Fear]] not [[knowledge]]. You [[shall]] [[escape]] the [[great]] [[lie]].”
