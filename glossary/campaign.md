Lea Artemis [[is]] a devoted follower of [[christ|Christ]], who pretends to be a man and fights for her God. Swearing [[an]] oath to [[Saint]] Nicholas, she [[leaves]] the Crusades behind and travels eastward in [[search]] of [[new]] knowledge. Weak in flesh, yet [[strong]] in the [[Word]], she [[holds]] the [[sword]] as [[an]] icon of [[divine]] favor.

Lea [[comes]] [[across]] the [[writings]] of Han Fei, the Chinese legalist scholar. He teaches that the law [[is]] [[written]] in the [[soul]], and that a person can [[only]] [[obey]] the law [[if]] [[they]] [[understand]] it.
