Gale's greatest challenge in Montreal is the [[pursuit]] of [[meaning]]. At [[first]] he pursues happiness via chasing the past (his fleeting [[relationship]] [[with]] Dawn), but [[meeting]] the [[architect]] at La Ronde kicked [[off]] a chain of events where he began questioning his own reasons for [[being]] in Montreal. [[Most]] notably, [[Tara]]'s suggestion that he [[elope]] [[with]] her presents itself as [[an]] alternative to [[being]] with Dawn, as Gale and [[Tara]] were once [[high]] [[school]] sweethearts who [[broke]] up in their [[first]] [[year]] of engineering at the University of Waterloo.
