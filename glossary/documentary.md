The witch gives a [[hallucinogenic]] drug to Dyron and Yugen that makes them see her as a beauty. Yugen can see through the illusion, but enjoys spending time in the fantasy watching the witch (in the form of a young woman) seduce Dyron.

The dragon of Potato Island comes, requesting that they evacuate so that he may burn the hut (his hobby / coping mechanism for the troubles back on his home island). The witch whistles, summoning the dragon with whom she made an alliance.

The witch tries to mount the Dragon of Potato Island, but is knocked off by Yugen's toolkit.

The Dragon of Potato Island took Dyron and Yugen to the Floating City of Aether, and went back to fight a battle.

Dyron swung his wand on the platform in the Floating City, as Yugen looked on. 


After fighting for a fortnight, the Dragon of Potato Island and the Dragon of the Wetlands were back to a stalemate. The former, worse in combat capabilities, is craftier. Within another week, the Dragon of Potato Island has a slight advantageâ€”one quickly squandered, then regained upon the other dragon's blunder. At the end of a month-long battle, the four weeks have left the Dragon of the Wetlands nearly defeated. He explains his past to the Dragon of Potato Island, saying that he allied with the witch when she was a young woman, and that he has supported her despite all his misgivings. He requests an alliance to revive the witch and her favorite of all her loves, Jequ. The Dragon of Potato Island declines, and lands the finishing blow.
