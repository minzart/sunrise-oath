June 21, 1999

On the last summer solstice of the twentieth century, Gale [[Jones]] was not the man he hoped to be. I [[know]], for I was [[there]], living inside his head, seeing the streets he walked in Montreal, feeling his urge to write and earn his name. I smoked a Belmont — inhale, hold, exhale — and crossed the street, heading back to a small un et demi in the McGill Ghetto. I typed on a Compaq til out of [[nicotine]] and inspiration, and brought a Walkman to bed at sunset. “Rewind”, “Play” — I fell asleep to [[an]] [[Elgar]] art song, and dreamed of [[an]] evening seven years [[ago]].
