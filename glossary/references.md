[[The]] Muslim criticizes [[the]] [[Christian]] [[as]] [[a]] tritheist. [[Is]] [[this]] [[a]] fair [[criticism]]? [[In]] [[one]] sense, I would say yes. The way Christians speak about God, the Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, would directly be [[understood]] as tritheism by a Muslim [[within]] their frame for what “consubstantial coexisting persons” [[means]]. Yet understanding it as I hope Christians do, the Trinity clearly refers to a monotheistic conception of God. The Muslim [[criticism]] of the Trinity is only correct by Muslim interpretation of Christian words. Now replace the Muslim with the Christian, and the Christian with the Mormon, and “consubstantial coexisting persons” with “[[distinct]] coeternal persons united in purpose”.
