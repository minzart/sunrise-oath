Ye [[see]] [[and]] [[hear]], [[that]] [[not]] [[alone]] [[at]] Ephesus, but almost throughout [[all]] Asia, [[this]] Paul hath persuaded [[and]] [[turned]] [[away]] [[much]] [[people]], saying [[that]] [[they]] [[be]] [[no]] gods, which [[are]] [[made]] [[with]] [[hands]]: [[So]] [[that]] [[not]] [[only]] [[this]] our craft is in [[danger]] to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess [[Diana]] should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth. And when they [[heard]] these sayings, they were full of [[wrath]], and cried out, saying, Great is [[Diana]] of the Ephesians.
