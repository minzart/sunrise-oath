Grow a [[tribe]] / community. Write their stories.  
  
For a newcomer to the [[tribe]], roll 3d6 for each of their statistics.  
Document all rolls separately.  
  
Each character's life path follows their highest and lowest statistic.  
  
When two characters [[have]] a child, it inherits from both.  
For each statistic, it gains [[one]] parent's highest, [[one]] parent's lowest, and a random roll.  
  
Roll under check system, with dice scaling with difficult.
