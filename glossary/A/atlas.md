Collis / Roslyn / Ishmael  
  
Gale is famous as the son of a painter who committed suicide. He was running away from more than he let on. His mother killed herself after the death of her father.  
  
Sylvie Maya Beaulieu was a student from New England. Alain Petit-Tremblay / Stephen Jones (Levi Atlas) grew up without a father, and eases into being the father of a child he is afraid of ever losing, and a son that might belong to him, not David / Levi.  
  
Levi is Gale's father. Gale is Ancra's cousin. Louise is to Levi what Charlotte is to Alain.  
  
Gale is the main branch heir of the Atlas line. Ancra is but the replacement.  
  
Sylvie and Abigail Jones are artists who commited suicide.
