[[In]] [[the]] quiet depths [[of]] [[the]] [[night]], [[a]] [[haunting]] [[thought]] emerges: [[a]] [[person]] confronts [[God]] [[within]] [[the]] realm [[of]] [[restless]] [[sleep]], while [[their]] [[conscience]] torments [[them]], preventing [[rest]]. [[The]] [[weight]] [[of]] [[guilt]] [[for]] committing regicide keeps [[them]] [[awake]], for their actions have stained their soul. The sinner, in truth, is no better than a slave, trapped in the grasp of their transgressions. They move through life like a serpent, blinded by the dust of their own wrongdoing, unable to see clearly the path ahead.
