[[Elara]] nods slowly, taking in the information. She tries to remember how she got here, but her memory is foggy.

"What happened to me?" she [[asks]].

"I don't know," the nurse says with a shrug. "You were brought in by some fishermen. They said you were badly injured and barely alive."

[[Elara]] thinks for a moment, trying to piece together what might have happened to her. She decides to explore the fortress and try to find out more about her [[situation]].

"Can you tell me how to get out of here?" she [[asks]] the nurse.

The nurse hesitates for a moment, then nods and gives [[Elara]] directions to the main entrance. [[Elara]] thanks her and gets out of bed, testing her strength. She feels weak, but determined.

As she makes her way through the fortress, [[Elara]] takes note of the layout and any potential exits. She tries to blend in with the other occupants of the fortress, hoping to avoid drawing attention to herself.

Once she reaches the main entrance, she steps outside and takes a deep breath of fresh air. She surveys the island and the lake, trying to get her bearings. She knows she needs to find out more about what happened to her and how she ended up here, but she's not sure where to start.

[[Elara]] keeps her [[guard]] up as she takes in her surroundings, scanning for any potential threats. She notices movement out of the corner of her eye and turns to see a figure approaching her. She narrows her [[eyes]] and tenses up, preparing for a possible attack.

The figure gets closer, revealing himself to be a scrappy-looking human male with shifty [[eyes]]. He introduces himself as Cade, a fellow thief.

Cade tries to engage [[Elara]] in conversation, but she is wary and doesn't reveal much about herself. She keeps her hand on her short [[sword]], ready to defend herself if necessary.

Cade attempts to pickpocket [[Elara]], but she's too quick for him. She senses his attempt and deftly dodges out of the way, drawing her [[sword]]. "Nice try," she says, keeping her [[sword]] pointed at him. "But I'm not an easy mark."

Cade backs off, holding up his hands in surrender. "Hey, I was just trying to make a living," he protests.

[[Elara]] [[eyes]] him suspiciously. "I'm a thief too," she says. "But I have standards."

Cade shrugs and backs away, disappearing into the shadows. [[Elara]] watches him go, feeling a mix of annoyance and pity. She knows what it's like to be desperate, but she's not willing to [[compromise]] her morals to survive.
