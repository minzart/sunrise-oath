I like [[thinking]] about all systems, incl. [[games]] and literatures and repertories and canons, as machines and [[self]]-replicating systems, ones which evolve and not [[only]] generate [[meaning]] for [[others]] but [[come]] to [[have]] their own internal [[logic]] and [[meaning]]. The mechanisms of the [[game]] certainly are [[fascinating]] and [[evocative]] in and of themselves.
