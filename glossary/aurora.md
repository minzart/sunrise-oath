I was sitting at my shrine trying to fix my music box. The top part of the rotating mechanism came off, and no matter how much I turned it wouldn't go on. I started meditating as I kept screwing, trying to keep my cool, wondering if I broke the thread. Then I saw a flash, and tried turning the other way. Turns out, the [[screw]] direction is reversed.
