The [[ceiling]] traps the wisps that yearns for sky and open air. A cigarette, yet [[burning]], bid the [[lips]] seek, the lungs take, the [[throat]] sigh. Humming, [[whether]] from the computer or the lights or the writer, drowns the chatter of the [[night]], the endless noise [[outside]] the un et demi. Contract forbid his smoking, and so what? Not like the landlord [[ever]] [[came]] to check, nor had the [[will]] to stop the way he chose to [[live]]. Gale [[Jones]] was [[without]] [[duty]], and vice versa; neither had stock in the [[other]] in the [[time]] and [[place]] that trapped them in their places.
