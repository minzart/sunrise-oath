Humans are [[the]] [[only]] [[ground]]-dwelling species that sings. [[There]] are [[over]] 4000 singing species â€” mostly birds, but [[also]] gibbons, dolphins, whales, and seals. But [[they]] [[all]] sing [[from]] [[water]] or [[the]] trees. When [[a]] [[bird]] lands [[on]] [[the]] [[ground]], it [[stops]].
