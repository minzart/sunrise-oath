I was a piano [[student]] at [[McGill]] who [[figured]] out he was no Rubinstein or Gould, and so [[sought]] to explore the canonical repertoire [[from]] a [[different]] angle. [[We]] [[could]] [[say]] I succeeded, as my fingers find themselves on a QWERTY keyboard rather [[than]] on the faux plastic ivories of the two [[grand]] pianos downstairs. I spend my days in blissful leisure, [[teaching]] a few lessons a week and otherwise spending my [[time]] absorbing art ([[jazz]], cinema, literary [[criticism]], my [[well]]-arranged room) and experimenting with [[creation]] (free improvisation, lyrical [[prose]], metered [[poetry]])â€Œ. [[Lest]] [[one]] gains the passive [[impression]] that I [[am]] rich and unaware, I [[say]] outright that I [[am]] unbelievably [[privileged]] to be [[living]] with two hardworking [[parents]] and a compassionate brother. [[Without]] them, this would not [[have]] [[been]] the [[most]] productive and [[fulfilling]] [[year]] of my life.
