Social Game [[with]] Index Cards  
  
1000 Blank Cards, [[with]] set rules for play priority.  
  
Cards are played by discarding cards and drawing them back. Players start [[with]] five cards. Any card may be played at any [[time]], though players take turns holding priority in clockwise order. Stack is last in, first out. Cards go to discard unless they have persistent effects.  
  
Cards that [[draw]] more cards are challenges. Cards that cost more cards affect other players in funny ways (and usually reward them).

Cards in both hands are face up.  
  
Each card is a piece, an action card (a move), and a commander.  
  
- piece: played on the board where another friendly card can move, a card acts as a piece [[with]] a moveset. The cost of each piece is one matching legal move on the board or in hand for each legal move on the card (where the card has the same legal move). Cards in hand must be discarded if used to pay a cost.  
(Each card pays for only one legal move.)  
  
- action: a piece may use a move from a card in hand and discard it.  
- commander: each player chooses one card to start on the board. A commander card may not have the same legal moves as any card in the deck.  
  
Each turn, choose one:  
- make a move  
- place a tile  
- pass the turn  
At the end of the turn, [[draw]] a card if able.  
  
Pieces are not captured. When a piece stands on another piece, the piece below is pinned. A pinned piece follows the orientation of the piece above.  
  
Win when opponent passes twice in a row.  
Lose when opponent passes twice in a row in their self map spot.  
  
Cards have three orientations: left, straight, right.  
  
Maximum one copy of card per deck (in Constructed).
