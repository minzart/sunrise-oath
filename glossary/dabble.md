[[With]] [[that]], [[he]] walked [[off]]. [[When]] [[he]] was gone, I [[took]] [[from]] my [[front]] pocket the partially developed [[photograph]]. The image was of a courtyard [[full]] of young men walking and talking, enjoying a sunny [[afternoon]]. Their attire was characteristic of seventeenth-century England, like they were on the set of a period drama. The [[picture]] offended my sensibilities, for my own perspective of the past was devoid of color. Even as [[part]] of the team that built this [[camera]], a [[part]] of me doubted that the [[scene]] depicted was of the past, of students [[from]] centuries ago, of people [[long]] gone. It was a precious [[record]] of the prime of countless youths, studying at [[one]] of the world’s oldest universities at a time without electricity, women’s rights, or a modern [[understanding]] of [[gravity]].
