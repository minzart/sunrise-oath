I debated writing something because rocking the boat is stressful and I want you guys to like me, but this inner conflict makes me [[feel]] called to respond and face the music. May God help me be clear and [[precise]] in my [[speech]]â€”yet words are [[imperfect]] ways of showing [[meaning]], and so I ask for charity.
