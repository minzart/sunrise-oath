The vocation of any believer, of anyone who has truly understood the gospel and seen it as the miracle that it is, is to be quiet in one's heart and to find stillness. It is to fret no longer about the institutions that man has created, about the precise boundaries of any idea, about allegiances to the angels and demons we dubbed as overlords. When we accomplish that, we walk with God along the beach, and may begin to truly understand what it means to take a single step. Before then, we are doomed to float about and be carried away by the windâ€”though even now, any one person is but a paper bag drifting from one side of the [[television]] screen to the other.
