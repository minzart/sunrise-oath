The doctor touched my cheek with the love of a mother, and said she was off to sleep. Every night she said this, but her eyes watched me as I climbed out of bed, stripped, and went to wash up.  
  
One day, as I stood in the bare skin that God created, she asked frankly: < Have you thought of doing it with me? >  
  
I glanced at the woman laying her fully clothed body on the new sheets that Selene left behind, and was fascinated by an averted gaze, a face unadorned by spectacles nor spectacle. < A little. > A small admission gave way to confession. < A lot. >  
  
< That makes me happy. > She flashed a smile void of sarcasm, got up, put on her coat and glasses, went out the door without another word.
