Snatch the [[orbs]] of hail that fall our way, and keep them as a snack, a midnight treat for the longest night of the year.  
  
Sunbound eidelon, release the contradictions of your faith.  
Abide in the thorns and spines of the written destination.  
  
Pastel seascapes paint the artist's fingers a purple blue.  
  
Bury the griefs that smolder in the light and open air.
