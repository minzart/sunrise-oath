> The measure of Earth's circumference is the most famous among the [[results]] obtained by Eratosthenes, who estimated that the meridian has a length of 252,000 [stadia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadion_(unit) "Stadion (unit)"), [[with]] an error on the real value between −2.4% and +0.8% (assuming a value for the stadion between 155 and 160 metres). Eratosthenes described his technique in a book entitled _On the measure of the Earth_, which has not been preserved.
