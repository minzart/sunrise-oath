Sadly, no one [[ever]] came to deliver me from my restlessness, and my [[parents]] [[took]] charge of my education rather than sending me off to an academy somewhere, [[magical]] or otherwise. Though I am thankful to my [[parents]] for tolerating my fascination with non-[[magical]] literature, back [[then]] I wished that they were more like the many magicians who decide to live in mainstream human communities and enroll their children in public schools. There was no longer any endangered Narnia to be saved, nor any whimsical Hogwarts to be explored. As much as one might [[wish]] that [[reality]] may make room for [[fiction]], it seemed that [[magical]] adventures would never [[come]] my way.
