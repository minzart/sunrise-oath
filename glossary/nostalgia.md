Exactly [[where]] [[he]] [[last]] [[saw]] [[her]], struggling [[new]] [[writer]] [[Gale]] [[Jones]] [[once]] [[again]] encounters [[the]] [[girl]] [[of]] [[his]] [[dreams]]. Or, rather, [[the]] [[beautiful]] [[stranger]] [[who]] haunts [[his]] [[restless]] slumber. [[She]] dons [[the]] [[same]] [[blue]] [[dress]] [[that]] [[she]] [[did]] [[on]] [[the]] [[fateful]] [[dinner]] cruise [[seven]] summers [[ago]], [[when]] [[they]] [[shared]] [[a]] [[dance]] on the deck of the ship. The [[scent]] of her vanilla perfume and of her strawberry perfume is exactly as he recalls [[from]] when he [[held]] her [[close]] for six [[short]] minutes. Her smile, the precious [[sight]] granted to him mere moments before she disappeared [[into]] the [[night]], is once more his [[alone]] to [[behold]].
