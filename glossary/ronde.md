“I’m not on speaking terms with Elena. Can’t stop arguing with her.” Tara laughed. “I’m terrible, right? She’s probably looking at the same sky as us right now. Speaking of which, do you remember where everything is?” 

We looked at her family’s favorite part of the sky, and thought of the woman who treated me as her son, or at least a close friend. She had an undying twinkle in her eyes, the same ones as her daughter’s, and took care of things in the Vici household that Eroica deemed unimportant. On the other hand, the Robles branch was to blame when something was not according to plan, though often everyone was better for it. Elena and Tara were more sisters than they were mother and daughter, and each had a habit of getting on the other’s nerves. “You two arguing is nothing new, “ I said to the architect.  

“She went too far.” The corner of her lip twitched. “It was about you, as always. You know what she said? That David’s not good for me, not like you were. Maybe she’s right, but shouldn’t she keep that to herself?”  

I could not look at her, and fixed my eyes on the Summer Triangle. “I’m sorry.”  

“This is the story of my family.” She pointed, for herself rather than for me. “Aquila, Cygnus, Lyra. Three constellations in an asterism, scattered apart yet seen as one.”  

“The eagle and the lyre,” I said. “And the swan.”  
Her hand reached for mine. “Did I ever tell you? Arab astrologers called Deneb the butt of a hen.”  

“I was there when Eroica said it,” I said, silently focused on the architect’s cold fingertips. “There are so many stories told about these stars. At the [[café]], a curator told me a Chinese legend about a cowherd and a weaver.”  

“Each time we learn something new, we take a step away from who we were,” Tara said. “We grew up. It’s great that you have a new life out here.” 

“Your life sounds better,” I said. “David, new friends, new career. I can’t imagine what kinds of things you’ve learned since we last spoke.”  


“Oh, right!” She let go, and stood from the bench. “A friend said there’s an Indian goddess with my name. ‘Tara’ means ‘star’ in Sanskrit.”  

I also got up. “You know what I always thought, but never said? Your name sounds like the [[Earth]].”  

Her tap on my shoulder was gentle, too gentle. “My name comes from Gaelic.”
