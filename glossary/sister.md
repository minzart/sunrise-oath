Tara and Louise become friends right before the end of high school, what she always wanted. They stopped talking after Tara heard of Gale talking to Louise, as Tara wanted Gale to move on with someone who he will see and love. She made Louise promise to be Gale's number one fan on Tara's own behalf.
