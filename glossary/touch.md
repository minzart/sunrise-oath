# Fury [[of]] [[the]] [[Twin]] Blades

[[This]] [[free]] module [[is]] [[system]] [[agnostic]]. [[I]] provide figures [[for]] [[a]] minimal ruleset (think simplified Knave) [[with]] [[only]] [[three]] statistics: STR, DEX, [[and]] HD. Interpret these as appropriate. (For magic, treat STR as INT and DEX as WIS.) [[All]] numbers [[and]] mechanics [[are]] [[inspired]] [[by]] the following seven *Magic* cards found on the Gatherer website:

* Sisters of the Flame
* Primaris Chaplain
* Oathkeeper, Takeno's Daisho
* Ephemeron
* Weathered Sentinels
* Colfenor's Plans
* Righteous Fury

## Background

> “We are many wicks sharing a common tallow; we feed the skies with the ashes of our prey.”

The Sisters of the Flame keep their oath away from the world, learning fire magic and becoming conduits of flame.

```
Sisters of the Flame
2 STR | 2 DEX | 3 HD 
* Three female humans in one pod of Sisters.
* Pods may channel for one round to cast a first level fire spell. 
* Pods may combine to cast higher level spells.
* Total of 2d6 groups in their mountain convent.
```

They recently welcomed a male outlander, a cleric, into their midst as that generation's sire. Loyal to a rising monarch, Primaris Astartes ministers to the cult of women as a chaplain, corrupting their doctrine for the benefit of his cause and shaping them into a fearsome magical military unit. 

```
Primaris Chaplain
3 STR | 3 DEX | 4 HD
* After attacking, give +1 STR to all allies in earshot of his battle cry.
* Cannot be killed while attacking or channeling.
```

Now, they have left their long seclusion in the mountains to enter the sacred garden of Colfenor, an old yew tree who protects the Oathkeeper, a powerful weapon stowed away by the founding father of the Sisters.

| 1   | An apostate sister warns of the operation. |
| 2   | The Oathkeeper beckons to a candidate bearer.    |
| 3   | Colfenor thirsts for magical waters.             |
| 4   | A prophecy predicts a massacre due to magecraft. |
| 5   | An ephemeral illusion taunts passersby.          |
| 6   | The marble sentinels seek aid, promising a reward.                                                 |





## Sacred Garden of Colfenor


Units of three marble statues, acting as one unit, guard the perimeter of the garden.

```
Weathered Sentinels
2 STR | 5 DEX | 3 HD
* Uses restraint against peaceful trespassers.
* Hits back against attacks as a reaction.
* Only attacks targets who attacked a friendly target.
* Gain +3 STR and +3 DEX while attacking a foe.
```


```
Ephemeron
4 STR | 4 DEX | 6 HD
* Flying
* As a familiar: the caster may discard a scroll to gain the summon spell.
```

The ephemeron is a trickster illusion who freely enters and leaves the garden, choosing sides based on his whims. If an adventurer tames the being by force or by wit, it submits to its new owner. The new familiar may be unsummoned at any time, incl. as a reaction in combat, by overwriting a magical scroll of sixth or higher level into a sixth level scroll that summons the ephemeron in battle.
