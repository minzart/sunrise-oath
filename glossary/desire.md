Alas, the bloodline [[covenant]] dictated that the head of the family can never leave the ancestral grounds. I, as Fatherâ€™s only child, was bound to live the same life that he [[lived]]: confined [[within]] the perimeter of the family [[property]], [[watching]] as his servants and friends left and entered the [[front]] gates as they wished. No [[matter]] how many [[magical]] adventures and scientific inquiry beckoned to me, I would [[remain]] a mere observer, researching the familial [[magical]] arts [[from]] [[day]] to [[day]] and forcing myself to be [[satisfied]] with only books and chats with visitors, through which I would vicariously live a [[free]] life.
