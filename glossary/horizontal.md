[[Note]] to [[self]] ([[well]], of [[course]]): [[write]] [[everything]] in the [[daily]] journals (or in [[an]] [[inbox]]), [[then]] excise them [[later]]. In fact, the [[best]] way to [[port]] [[may]] simply [[be]] to [[copy]] everything [[into]] this file, [[then]] slowly [[[[kick]]]] them out [[later]]. Saves on [[brain]] work and gets the [[process]] [[started]].
