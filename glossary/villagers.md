[[The]] [[eyes]] [[of]] [[the]] [[world]] [[never]] [[sleep]]. [[Everything]] [[is]] too [[much]] to [[grip]] in your hands. All you can do is kick back and sit on the hoard you call the universe.  
  
Settle in as who you are. No need to earn your keep or stake your place. You never have to find another home. The way to have a clean room is to see the face of God in the geometry of drawers.  
  
Take everything and put them into boxes. Later, take them out and tell a story, as if they were packed by a divine hand. What scripture can you glean?  
  
All of life is God showing you ink blot tests and watching you squirm. We know our choices as they were written, as lines in a play.
