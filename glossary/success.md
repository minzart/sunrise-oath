[[Imagine]] [[getting]] a divorce with your spouse of 15 [[years]] because they [[are]] irritable. [[Turns]] out, they just had a benign tumour in their [[brain]], which they had taken out [[after]] he inherits a [[long]] [[lost]] relative's huge [[company]]. They revert back to the person you [[fell]] in love with, [[get]] [[married]] with [[someone]] [[better]] [[than]] you, and [[leave]] you in your room [[crying]] while binging on misordered [[anchovy]] pizza.
