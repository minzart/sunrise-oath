Discovered I [[can]] [[make]] folders in this vault, and [[now]] I'm more sold [[than]] before. I [[wish]] I didn't stop using this, [[since]] [[every]] [[time]] I adopt a [[technology]] related to decks and randomized [[action]] I [[get]] [[so]] excited.

[[There]]'s [[something]] [[about]] [[cards]]. I see in the [[paper]] cards the [[aspect]] of Satan. [[Maybe]] the [[Christians]] [[are]] right to [[be]] worried about [[Magic]]: the [[Gathering]].

Organizing this Obsidian [[has]] made it [[much]] more comfortable to sit in! It's almost like I [[put]] furniture [[into]] [[an]] [[empty]] room. [[Maybe]] that was [[all]] it really [[needed]]. Dusting [[off]] the shelves and putting in the knicknacks [[is]] [[all]] it [[took]] to create [[heaven]] on [[earth]].

I [[make]] the [[commitment]] [[now]] to [[write]] [[every]] [[day]], [[even]] [[if]] it [[is]] [[all]] contained in [[notes]] like the [[one]] here. [[After]] [[typing]] here, I [[can]] [[edit]] in the [[future]] and build as I [[go]]. [[There]] [[is]] no rush to [[do]] anything except [[getting]] [[started]].

I [[am]] a [[great]] writer. I [[am]] a [[great]] [[artist]]. [[History]] [[will]] tell, but [[only]] [[if]] I [[speak]].
