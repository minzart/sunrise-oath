You [[wrote]] [[me]] a [[long]] letter, for which I was [[glad]]. I [[feel]] that the emotional tenor of [[our]] [[friendship]] [[has]] always [[been]] [[one]] of [[growth]] and [[learning]]. [[When]] [[we]] [[first]] [[met]], and [[when]] [[we]] conducted [[our]] [[first]] lessons [[together]], I was impressed at [[how]] [[much]] you wanted to [[seek]] [[better]] knowledge and a clearer [[picture]]. This was [[all]] before I [[gained]] [[confidence]] that [[my]] way of [[teaching]] was the right [[path]], that it had any [[value]] to the world. Your trust in [[me]] [[means]] a lot, and perhaps by itself [[is]] enough to sustain [[me]] in a lifelong [[pursuit]] of [[better]] pedagogy and greater musical heights. I practice [[nowhere]] near enough to [[make]] [[real]] [[all]] the lofty ideals [[we]] [[have]] [[sought]] [[together]], but a dream unfulfilled [[is]] [[beautiful]] in and of itself. To [[have]] [[seen]] the pearly gates, and [[never]] [[enter]], [[is]] [[better]] [[than]] [[having]] [[been]] to [[blind]] to [[never]] see. (And in [[another]] [[time]] and [[another]] life, I think a [[school]] [[along]] the lines of [[what]] [[we]] wanted to create [[shall]] [[do]] [[much]] [[good]] for the world, not [[only]] in putting [[forward]] a [[new]] vision for art but a [[new]] way for [[people]] like [[our]] [[parents]].)
