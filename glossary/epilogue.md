While [[we]] are here, let [[me]] tell you a [[story]]: some weeks before I [[left]] the un et demi in Montreal on Durocher near Sherbrooke, the [[same]] [[one]] that houses the protagonist Gale [[Jones]], I wrote [[an]] [[outline]] for a visual novel ([[an]] interactive fiction picture book, a genre that fascinated [[me]] for [[much]] of my teenage years) where each chapter matched a rhyming couplet from the lyrics, penned by [[Elgar]]’s wife Caroline Alice née Roberts as a love gift. As I wallowed in my [[despair]] that the city [[needed]] [[me]] not, I wrote a [[story]] from my past [[into]] the [[fabric]] of [[false]] [[reality]]: when I was seventeen, the [[same]] [[age]] as Gale in the [[story]], I indeed [[shared]] a [[dance]] with a [[beautiful]] stranger on my last evening in Montreal. The [[end]] of a YMCA cultural exchange had come, and what a bittersweet hug-and-sway it was with E, a girl from a high school across town in Waterloo. In [[truth]], she was not a complete stranger; [[we]] [[saw]] each [[other]] at [[an]] informational session before [[we]] departed, and from exploring the city a few times together [[we]] connected with offbeat [[humor]], [[much]] of it centered [[around]] 420 and shunning authority. I learned that she had a boyfriend who was not with us on the [[trip]]. That was not on my mind when I asked her to [[dance]], for all I knew in the [[moment]] was the sparkle in her [[eye]]. I never [[saw]] her [[again]] [[after]] that [[trip]], but I [[shall]] never forget [[how]] stunning she was. Looking at her pictures on Facebook, I see that she is in a [[different]] world from [[me]]. Yet for the few minutes that she was in my arms, I [[pretended]] that she was forever mine, that she was my fated bride, that she was [[someone]] who would change my life and save [[me]] from all the [[things]] I knew not [[how]] to [[escape]].
