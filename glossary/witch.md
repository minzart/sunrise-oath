“Look at our shadows,” I marveled. “Mine is darker. I [[wonder]] why that is.”  
Selene blinked, and flashed a faint smile. “I am a ball of pale fire.” She hummed ‘Autumn Leaves’, and made a face. “I never know the words to any song. A strange affliction, my one glaring weakness.”  
“Not even to the birthday song?” I asked.  
“Only as [[trivia]],” she said. “Soon as I have to sing, my mind goes blank. The melody is all I ever know.”  
This reminded me of someone else, but as I tried to speak the curator pulled me out of the way of a passerby.  
“What [[shall]] you ever do when I leave?” she said, leaving her hand on my elbow. “Wǒ hǎo shěbudé nǐ.”  
I smiled. “Mandarin, right? What does it mean?”  
She squeezed with her long fingers, and [[we]] stopped walking. The curator almost said something, then withdrew her touch and put on her aviators, winking with a blue almond eye that hid behind the gleam of rainbow on the dark lens. “Too hard to translate.”  
  
I think of Catherine, who cannot sing without accompaniment, at least not with the [[proper]] notes. The pitches are in tune, but invariably she strays from the tune and comes up with something or another. Soon as [[Louise]] starts playing, everything clicks into place. “[[There]] is an inner logic to the music,” the engineer says, [[after]] a performance of Debussy’s ‘Pierrot’. “The harmony of the spheres in microcosm.”
