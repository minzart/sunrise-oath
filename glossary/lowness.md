Pretend [[that]] someone is reading. What would I write? Something about the games I love to play, I bet. I think about them day and night, coming up with different ways to amuse myself without a partner. I see now that my storytelling came from something of a weird obsession (and so I guess a deep repression) with choosing how a story goes. I see now that the major struggle in my life was seeing that I was not my parents' pawn and could slash them down to size or even kill them. Whenever that is at the front of mind, I have the [[confidence]] to do anything, least of all commit these convictions to paper.
