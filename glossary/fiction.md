Luckily, even the small sphere of [[reality]] around me was filled to the brim with other worthwhile pursuits — and Father was more [[than]] [[happy]] to [[help]] sate my natural [[curiosity]] with the [[help]] of our esteemed guests. Though I can hardly be considered an expert on non-[[magical]] culture and customs, I can confidently assure any sheltered [[magical]] readers that [[everyone]] I have [[met]] in the outside world would be shocked to [[hear]] that magicians often keep scientists as their closest companions. There was no greater honor to the oldest [[magical]] households [[than]] to host professors and researchers of the sciences, and to lend assistance through whatever [[means]] available — whether that be offering [[funds]] [[from]] the ancestral coffers or producing rare and expensive materials through [[magical]] manipulation.
