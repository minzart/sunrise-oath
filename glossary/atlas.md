Collis was blind, and gained [[sight]] on the day ere she left. This [[is]] what changed the timeline. The magical entanglement [[with]] the daughter of Flamel caused a new world to come into being, where  
  
Ancra made Collis born without magic. Knowing this, the daughter of Flamel entangled herself [[with]] her. This [[is]] to have a non-mage under her tutelage and control without having to meet anyone else.  
  
Daughter of Flamel [[later]] pairs [[with]] her lover, [[after]] Collis regains her heritage as a mage.
