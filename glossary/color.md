I find it interesting from a lore perspective that roughly the "protagonist color" of Magic went from artifacts/colorless (early) to blue (middle) to [[white]] (late).

Matches what I personally [[know]] of the history of symbols and consciousness. 

[[White]], the order and organization of conscious multitudes, created a group mind and a sense of the "objective world". 

[[Black]], the taste of [[sacrifice]] and evil and death, was the evolving sense of action for deliberated benefit, the "argument for evil" as represented by a snake. 

Red, impulse and instinct itself, is the [[first]] [[human]] [[acting]] in paradise, sans shame or worry, and leading to rebellion. 

Artifice, the creation of tools and the mastery of material, is associated [[with]] Cain and Vulcan, the [[first]] artisans. 

Green, the appeal to and participation in [[nature]], is the [[first]] in a long line of [[human]]-created institutions, in the form of might makes right. 

Blue, the formalized and structured [[thought]] that came from literary and rhetorical traditions, made words (and "the [[Word]]"). And then [[with]] the emergence of an [[even]] larger multitude of multitudes (cells are to humans what humans are to [[humanity]]), now [[there]] is a new type of "[[sight]]". 

So, [[white]] comes back, but on a new higher level of sociocultural abstraction. Not saying that this is necessarily what Garfield had in mind ([[there]]'s [[many]] ways of analyzing structured faction-based lore) [[Also]] worth noting that in anthropology, it is proposed that [[white]] and [[black]] were the [[first]] consciously recognized colors, and [[after]] that came red, yellow/green, and (most recently) blue. And each cultural shift could roughly be [[said]] to be strain between the "old colors" and the "new colors". 

For example, seeing red added a new dimension to [[sight]] [[other]] than "on-[[off]]" signal, and created a more complex hierarchy of meaning, esp. of blood and nutrition and [[value]].
