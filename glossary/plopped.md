That [[was]] how I found out Tara Robles was back. I could scarcely recognize who she became in one year. We first spoke to each other at a high school football game in â€™89. Timothy Clement, a boy from science class, ran [[into]] me at [[Starbucks]] after school. I planned to study some more and [[head]] back home, but he [[insisted]] I join him. It was a grudge match [[between]] our school and our longstanding rival. The game was big enough to be hosted not at our school, but at an arena down the block owned by the smaller of two [[local]] universities.
