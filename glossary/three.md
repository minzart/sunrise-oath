**MANDATE**
a *Magic: the Gathering* custom multiplayer [[game]] mode

[[compatible]] with
**ARCHENEMY & CONSPIRACY

- - -

(*Prepare a mandate deck. Mandates are cards randomly selected from a mandate deck of standard* Magic: the Gathering *cards*. *[[If]] a mandate would be shuffled in a [[library]], [[moved]] to a hand, or controlled by a [[new]] player, [[place]] it in the command zone.**)

At the [[start]] of the match, choose a player to become the emperor. The emperor goes last in the turn order when a [[game]] begins and [[may]] play mandates from the command zone.

When you become the emperor, [[draw]] a mandate and gain control of all mandates.
  
{T}: At the beginning of your next [[end]] step, target opponent becomes the emperor.

As you lose the [[game]], the player who causes you to lose the [[game]] becomes the emperor. [[Start]] a [[new]] [[game]] in the match, leaving this emblem and all mandates in the command zone.  

[[If]] you win the [[game]] or [[an]] opponent loses the [[game]], you win the match.
