In a forest, an imp of [[wind]] and frost tempts Lea and Primo [[with]] [[false]] riches and tainted scripture, and traps them in a labyrinth. Convinced that she is burning in hell, Lea takes [[off]] her armor and wanders the storm naked. She falls in a river, and is severely frostbitten. Her third doubt, presented in the form of the serpent, is in the power of oath and convenant itself. She removes the earthen ring and takes a new talisman from a mermaid who saves her. Primo finds her, but she is empty. Her greatest strength, the Word, was lost to her in the lake. She could no longer speak. Her birthright as a knight, as a conqueror of evildoers, was taken from her.
