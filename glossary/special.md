Heading north, they arrive in [[gem|Gem]] City. [[There]], while [[Azi]] meditates and [[Aldous]] recuperates from his injuries, [[Corrin]] wanders the city for clean vestments and accidentally encounters the [[widow]], though she claims to be seeing her husband soon. In reality, she was going to make an offering to him at home, leading up to a journey to his demonic [[mausoleum]]. Before parting ways, she tells the knight to kill a monk if he ever encounters one. Back at the inn, [[Corrin]] relays the information that [[Larissa]] hates him and [[is]] married.
