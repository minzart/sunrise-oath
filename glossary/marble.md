[[So]] [[sweet]] [[is]] [[the]] [[music]] [[of]] the [[imagined]] [[performances]] delivered on a virtual stage, soaking in the liquid cowardice of the wandering artist in pursuit of great or bigger accomplishment, the kind they never had as a child in the classroom or the parlor. Living in the past, interpreting anew one's childhood, is the precursor to theology and heresy. Every truth created destroys an old unknown til all that lay properly ruined is built into a temple of monstrous proportion dedicated to the golf game that never ends, putting a tiny ball into a tiny hole on a vast field carefully tended by brown-skinned miracle workers.
