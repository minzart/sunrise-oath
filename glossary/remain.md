[[I]] would be arranged to marry a second or third son from another family, selected for their strong affinity to magic and their sensibilities regarding the outside world. With time to consider the idea, I might [[come]] to [[accept]] him and love him as my husband. With him, I would conceive a healthy firstborn, and would raise them as my eventual successor. For the rest of my [[long]] life, my greatest duty would be to perfectly perform my purpose â€” to ensure my genetic and [[magical]] lineage, to stay within the [[stony]] walls.
