Everyone [[dreams]] in REM sleep. But [[we]] [[remember]] those [[dreams]] [[best]] when [[we]] wake up before it ends. Living out a dream to the very end means [[we]] are more likely to forget it.  
  
Charlotte tells [[Gale]] that no matter what, that dream will be [[with]] him, [[even]] if he remembers not.  
  
[[Gale]] [[is]] like Dawn, except forgetting his [[night]] [[dreams]].  
(Dawn [[is]] aimless for she has [[forgotten]] her [[dreams]], her purpose in life.)
