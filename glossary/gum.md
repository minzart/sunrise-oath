[[In]] [[my]] delirium, [[Charlotte]]â€™s daily visits were [[my]] [[last]] [[link]] [[to]] [[the]] [[outside]] [[world]]. [[She]] stayed [[for]] four or so hours [[at]] [[a]] [[time]], except [[on]] [[Sunday]]. [[She]] came [[late]] [[on]] Saturday [[night]], and passed out until [[early]] Monday [[morning]]. [[At]] [[first]] [[I]] tried staying up, but gave up [[in]] [[the]] [[end]] and lay next [[to]] her. When [[I]] woke up, [[the]] doctor [[was]] still fast asleep. [[I]] went [[back]] [[to]] [[my]] writing, and when [[the]] [[time]] came [[she]] [[got]] up, [[borrowed]] [[my]] shower, and headed out [[on]] [[my]] own.
