Hilbert 54  
  
[[Game]] where the player goes up and [[down]] levels in a persistent magical "hotel" [[with]] cards. Guests regularly get moved up and [[down]] floors, represented by cards [[being]] added to the deck. When guests leave, all [[other]] guests are moved to fill in the gaps.  
  
Win by [[having]] more points (cards of suit or rank matching initial).

How should a [[story]] [[start]]? A hidden [[truth]], [[beyond]] the comprehension of a small mind like mine, may well be treated as a fairy tale.

[[player|I]] find my way to a hotel [[with]] infinite floors. [[Every]] floor is a single room, [[every]] room is a strange land, and [[every]] visitor is a stranger to [[me]]. Yet, I seem to [[remember]] each [[one]] from a past life.

Entering the lobby, a concierge looks at [[me]] [[with]] severe eyes, blue regards that soften at my [[sight]]. “You’re here, mon gars.” So [[personal]], yet so unfamiliar. “Come [[with]] [[me]]. I [[shall]] show you to the elevator.”

Once the doors are closed, he pulls out a bag of dice, producing a handful of d20 and a d6.

“Dice are currency here,” he explains. He casts six d20 of six colors, and watches them fall in [[place]]. Then he casts six d6 of the [[same]] color, less enthusiastically.

I look on, and see the numbers come up. “I [[have]] no idea what these mean.”

“Commit them to memory,” he says and jotted them on a sheet of paper, handing them to [[me]]. 

I read his neat handwriting:

> [[White]] / Plains (W): [d20]
> Blue / Island (U): [d20]
> [[Black]] / Swamp (B): [d20]
> Red / Mountain (R): [d20]
> Green / Forest (G): [d20]
> Colorless / Waste (C): [d20]
> [[Wallet]]: [d6 d6 d6 d6 d6 d6]

“A d20 will get you through doors and into hearts or minds. A d6 will exchange for that which may be bought. Mana, and money.” He pats my shoulder—though he is younger than [[me]], it feels so right—and inputs a [[number]] on the touchscreen panel. Then he turns to [[me]] and explains: “Your mana depletes from using spells, and is increased in between visits to rooms. Rest is the magician's greatest ally.”

“Do I [[have]] my own room?” I [[ask]].

“On [[every]] floor,” he replies. “You [[shall]] [[have]] a bed, and amenities, and a roommate. Everyone is expecting you, and everyone has their advice on where you might explore next.” He reaches in his pocket [[again]], and pulls out two basic lands. “Ever seen Magic cards?”

“No,” I answer, though I am not so sure. “What does it do?”

“You tap it by turning it sideways,” he demonstrates, “and your mana increases by [[one]]. Since I gave you a basic land of the [[same]] color as your highest and lowest rolls, you now [[have]] access to [[one]] more mana of those two colors. Up to twenty, of course.”

> Gain a basic land of your highest and lowest rolls.

“Your lands untap upon arriving on a new floor,” he says, “as well as each [[time]] you wake up. ”

“I [[have]] to fiddle [[with]] cards while I’m at the hotel?” I groan.

“Do it in your head [[if]] you [[want]], or on paper.” He shrugs. “The [[game]] state is what matters. Represent it however you wish.”

“[[Game]] state,” I repeat. “So this is a [[game]].”

“Very much so,” he says. “This is a [[game]] of Magic, and you [[have]] two basic lands in play right now. You [[have]] mana of five types floating, each represented by a d20. The d6 [[have]] nothing to do [[with]] the [[game]] for now, unless you ever [[want]] to replace a [[die]] roll.”

“[[Players]] roll dice in Magic?” I [[ask]].

“The joke sets do everything these days,” he says. “Anyway, you [[have]] no cards in hand or library. Go [[ahead]] and add some [[if]] you [[want]]. But you may [[also]] proceed [[without]] them, and simply [[use]] [[an]] online database like Gatherer [[if]] you [[need]] to generate or find a card.”

I nod, and do as I wish.

“[[Remember]] [[one]] thing: your mana [[pool]] can [[only]] be depleted by giving it to [[another]] [[mage]], by casting a spell, or by gaining mana past twenty.” He points at my basic lands. “Tap those, and your mana goes up. At twenty mana, adding [[one]] more mana puts you back at [[one]] mana.”

“It loops around.”

“Precisely,” he says. “By the way, the person you are about to see is the exact person you wish to talk to most. Be ready.”

I gulp. “Who’s that?”

“You‘ll see,” he says, and the elevator [[stops]]. I notice that the floor [[number]] is the exact [[same]] as the sum of all my d20 values, minus the lowest [[value]] of the d6 in my [[wallet]]. “Since this is a [[self]]-journaling [[adventure]], you will [[have]] to decide what happens next. Get your pen and paper ready! [[Remember]]: d20 are skill checks and mana, d6 are items and money.”
