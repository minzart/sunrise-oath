In this version the infantrymen moved as pawns of all times and places, excepting the [[modern]] two-square debut. The cavalrymen were placed and manipulated in the same manner as the knight. The elephantsâ€™ movements were diagonal and limited to two squares, therefore they were inherently weaker than the bishops into which they were later transformed. The chariots were equal in every respect to the castles which through some ripple in history came to be [[called]] rooks. And the counselor, beside the king, moved diagonally also and only one square per move; as time passed its powers were increased to that of the bishop, thereby considerably enhancing the [[complexity]] of the game.
