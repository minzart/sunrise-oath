This all came to mind as I strolled outside Woolsthorpe Manor, the birthplace and family residence of Isaac Newton. After trying and failing to [[get]] a good shot of Newton at work indoors, all that was left was outdoors. It was said that it was [[from]] the branches of the tree in the [[garden]] that an apple fell. If it did [[ever]] happen, it must have been during those precious [[years]] away [[from]] Cambridge, while Europe was afflicted by the bubonic plague. A fence surrounded the treeâ€™s perimeter, preventing visitors [[from]] [[sitting]] under it like Newton might have. How lonely it must be to be cordoned [[from]] the world with a wooden enclosure that did no justice to its [[timeless]] [[majesty]].
