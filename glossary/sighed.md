While [[reading]] in Brick Magazine of Stan Dragland’s demise, I [[saw]] a [[synchronicity]] to [[use]]. August 2, 2022. Coincidentally, this date aligns with [[something]] I [[have]] worked on for two [[years]], a novel I [[have]] [[called]] The [[Wind]] at Dawn, [[after]] [[an]] art [[song]] by the [[English]] composer Edward [[Elgar]]. In the [[story]], a writer of no [[great]] achievement pursues his [[craft]] in Montreal, the [[city]] where [[seven]] [[years]] ago he [[met]] the love of his [[dreams]] on a [[Saint]] Lawrence summer dinner cruise. This [[magical]] evening was on August 2, [[1992]]—thirty [[years]] before the [[current]] [[year]], in which the [[epilogue]] takes [[place]]. The span of thirty [[years]] is significant to the [[plot]], secondary [[only]] to the recurrent gap of [[seven]] [[years]]. My [[obsession]] with dates [[could]] not let this go. I [[got]] up [[from]] my [[reading]] desk, and immediately sat here in [[front]] of my computer, the very [[time]] and [[place]] [[from]] which I [[now]] [[speak]] to you.
