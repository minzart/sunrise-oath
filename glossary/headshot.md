I studied poker a lot [[after]] I had a small interest in it. This is in [[many]] ways the ultimate "strategy [[game]]", since it is [[an]] example of a [[game]] where the [[better]] [[players]] usually come out on top. Playing 1000 chess [[games]] against your friend is unreasonable and exhausting, but playing 1000 poker hands is [[much]] more straightforward. However, [[there]] is [[an]] element that makes this [[game]] strangely frustrating to [[learn]] (since [[learning]] requires [[short]]-term feedback as reinforcement): RNG. You can calculate that based on your opponent's perceived tightness with their hands, their odds of ripping a full house on the river to beat your straight is [[only]] 4%, and so you can safely bet (or [[even]] raise). However, 1 in 25 [[games]] with this [[situation]] you will get utterly screwed when their out does come [[down]]. Most situations are not this extreme and instead [[have]] smaller "odds advantages". [[Imagine]] [[learning]] poker when you are making appropriate decisions, but you are pretty [[much]] [[being]] repeatedly [[punished]] for them. Losing money on losses [[also]] limits the amount of "education" a person can afford before the [[game]] just becomes too expensive.
