On [[Sunday]], I was [[hired]] at a [[café]], the [[one]] I [[saw]] in [[Old]] Montreal. The next [[day]] at [[Alexandra]] Basin, I declared to the [[beautiful]] [[stranger]]: “I’m a barista at Génoise et Thé.”

“Is that so,” she [[said]], not [[looking]] up from the scribbles in my [[old]] [[journal]].

“I’d [[come]] here anyway, is what I’m saying. The [[Old]] [[Port]] is the [[best]] [[place]] for [[reading]] before work.”

“Hard to [[read]] with your eyes staring up at [[me]],” she replied with a smile. “[[Still]] on that [[page]]?”

My ears [[feeling]] hot, I went back to Le [[Silence]] de la mer. The next [[time]] I looked up, all [[there]] was next to [[me]] on the [[bench]] was my [[journal]], its [[pages]] [[flapping]] in the wind. Dawn was [[gone]], and was not mine to find til the next [[day]]. When the [[time]] [[came]], I [[left]] to go to [[work]].
