[[Necessarily]], processes [[are]] either deterministic or random. Stochastic models, for example for bioelectricity, can [[still]] be describing deterministic phenomena; similarly, deterministic models can be describing random phenomena. My suspicion is that randomness is [[only]] a [[matter]] of ontological [[horizon]], and there [[are]] [[ultimately]] deterministic causes for everything. This is a religious [[belief]], in effect. I [[have]] no answer as to [[if]] the ultimate [[nature]] of the [[universe]] is deterministic or random, and it is out of the scope of this discussion.  
  
[[If]] there is in fact fundamental [[dualism]] in the [[universe]] that [[also]] allows for contrafactual free [[will]], I suspect this [[may]] not be verifiable. [[Even]] in this [[situation]], a mechanical description is apt barring truly demonstrably out-of-[[context]] [[action]].  
  
My [[point]] [[also]] stands with a usage in which [[something]] is "deterministic" [[if]] it is meaningfully modeled by [[an]] isomorphism, [[whether]] or not the [[nature]] of [[physics]] is in fact random. In the [[end]], all experimental [[results]] [[are]] processed [[through]] [[consciousness]] and [[value]] hierarchies. "[[Close]] enough" or "sufficiently usable" is the ultimate [[standard]], and this [[standard]] differs for the application and the applicant.
