[[September]] 4, 1999, the hottest [[day]] of the [[year]], I watched the sunrise with Dawn. I asked the same [[hazel]]-eyed brunette in the same [[pale]] [[blue]] dress: “What’s your oldest memory?”

She thought, and [[answered]]: “Our first reunion, the [[morning]] after Canada [[Day]].”

“Nothing from before?”

“My brain’s a picky eater. I don’t know what I had for breakfast, yet I recall every [[word]] of our conversations.”

“This is [[incredible]] to me.”
