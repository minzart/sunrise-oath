[[Tara]] has [[seen]] [[David]] for [[two]] years, but is unsure of the next step. She offers [[Gale]] to elope together, [[if]] he chooses her over Louise. He is unsure, esp. as he has met David once. Catherine knew about them dating, but [[revealed]] it not and warned him to [[keep]] quiet, to [[keep]] the [[peace]]. She tells him to call her before her birthday on the winter solstice, as at twenty-four she [[shall]] move on.
