In high school, I stayed out past bedtime, and sometimes past public transit hours. In search of [[lost]] [[time]], regaining years of harsh discipline, I walked home and let my mind wander for [[an]] hour or so. So precious was this solitude, utter and [[absolute]] in the years ere my [[first]] smartphone [[plan]], that [[if]] I boarded a bus at [[midnight]], I stayed on and rode all the way to the terminal at the Boardwalk. The route looped back to my neighborhood [[after]] the [[driver]] finished his smoke or piss, but [[if]] the bus was out of service he kicked [[me]] [[off]] and [[left]] [[me]] to savor the air of the [[new]] part of town, the fresh [[future]] of the city I called my own.
