Tutoring, [[culture]] nights [[with]] Louise, and dance lessons. Like that, the five of us spent the summer on studies, films, and dance.

A week before orientation, a year after our first kiss, Tara and I lay in her [[bed]], staring at her [[ceiling]].“I wonder if Eroica can keep tutoring us.”

“We’ll manage on our own. It’s my turn to take care of you.”

“Teehee, that makes me happy.” She touched our noses, then checked the time and groaned. “I don’t want to see the Queen of the Goody Two-[[Shoes]], but I want to dance.”

“Then we’ll dance in the living room with the record player.”

“I’m so spoiled.” She fell against her pillow. “Will you care for me forever?”

“Forever’s a long time.”

“Lie to me, for [[now]].”

“Then I’ll care for you forever.”

“No [[takebacks]]!”
