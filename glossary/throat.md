[[The]] [[red]]-clad lasses arranged [[into]] [[a]] pyramid, and [[my]] latent simian instincts picked up that [[the]] smallest [[one]] of the bunch, the cute strawberry blonde at the top, was Tara Robles without glasses. No doubt she was roped in by pushy seniors. Through the colorful [[face]] paint, dramatic makeup, and glossy exuberance plastered on her [[face]], I saw she loathed every second of the spotlight. We never exchanged more than glances in math class, but I knew her to be a serious student. Packing up slowly after the bell, I watched her [[stay]] to ask questions scribbled in her spiral [[notebook]], [[waiting]] for Catherine to finish trying to [[impress]] the teacher. I had a boyish fascination for Tara, enjoying how she rolled her eyes at the teacher’s pet, how she furrowed her brow as she considered our teacher’s comments. To me, she was humble and hardworking. More than that, she was [[honest]]. All this I came to know by watching her, both in class and at the football game.
