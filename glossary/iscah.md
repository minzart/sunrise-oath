[[Jessica]] was a childhood friend, and she thanked me [[after]] our [[dance]] on freshman night [[with]] a gorgeous laugh. I was hurt when she teased me and my new girlfriend, and talked smack about me to her new friends [[after]] she switched high schools. I [[later]] went [[with]] her on [[an]] summer exchange to Montreal, and apologized for everything on the last night. She was gentle and gracious, more than needed, and that was our last conversation.
