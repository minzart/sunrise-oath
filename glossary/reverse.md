Starting with the sound of robins drifting in through my open window, I focus on the ringing of my eardrums and imagine hearing the [[screech]] of eagles overhead, then imagine myself as the bird of prey looking down at the field below, seeing the small motion of a mark in the midst of the tall grasses. Then I am the mouse, seeing the shadow too late and having nothing better to do than to engage in a futile escape. Then I am the worm that eats the dead predator, recycling it into the cosmosâ€”oh, now I am a dust particle between galaxies, alone and never lonely.
