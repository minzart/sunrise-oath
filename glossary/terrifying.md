[[We]] waited [[for]] her [[at]] Génoise et Thé, musing about [[epistemology]] [[over]] [[Alain]]’s [[coffee]]. [[After]] [[an]] [[hour]], [[the]] doctor pushed away [[The]] [[New]] Yorker and [[said]]: “Rien ne colle. Elle cache quelque chose.”

“Mon soupçon, ton juste avertissement.” Her cup clinked [[on]] [[a]] coaster. “Prudence, [[Gale]] [[Jones]].”

[[We]] [[observed]] [[Hortus]] direct [[the]] [[new]] staff behind [[the]] counter, [[recalled]] [[how]] [[things]] were before [[Selene]], and [[parted]] [[on]] [[the]] [[hour]].
