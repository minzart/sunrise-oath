[[The]] [[lobby]] guest [[book]] reveals [[that]] [[the]] [[location]] [[is]] [[the]] underground jailhouse [[for]] [[a]] [[religion]]. 

[[In]] [[the]] [[left]] corridor, [[a]] large cut [[stone]] blocks [[the]] [[way]], with only a narrow gap on either side. (The stone is buoyant in water!)

[[In]] [[the]] [[right]] corridor, [[a]] praying nun tells [[the]] [[adventurer]] [[and]] [[his]] ally that outlaws have taken shelter in an inner room; she invites them to capture them, in exchange for a powerful item and her assistance in a baptism in the fountain at the center of the dungeon. The ritual requires the blood of the outlaws.
