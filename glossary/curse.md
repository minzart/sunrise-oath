[[Let]] [[us]] [[see]] [[on]] [[the]] [[silver]] lake
[[The]] [[moon]] descending, [[once]] [[awake]].

[[The]] [[mirror]] [[of]] [[the]] waters [[change]]
Less [[than]] [[your]] [[soul]], [[my]] lover [[strange]].

[[Selene]] [[who]] casts [[her]] furtive beams
[[Takes]] [[light]] [[the]] [[pain]] [[of]] lovers’ [[dreams]].

[[And]] so my soft and plaintive song 
Shall never know your comfort wrong.

The love of man, a heavy grief,
The pity of a woman, brief.

Let us see on the silver lake
The moon [[descend]] for goodness’ sake.

My teacher was a fleeting ghost, 
A lie for one short year.
What I might soon [[regret]] the most
Is fit for only God to hear.
