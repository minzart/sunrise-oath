If one decides that all the force one likes is fine and everything else is 'violence',
then it is easy to be peaceful. After all, this 'peace' has no cost to the person themselves.
Christ, however, took no arms against his fellow brother. To those who hated him, he had riddles.
To those who loved him, he had mysteries.
