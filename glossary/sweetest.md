[[I]] finished inside [[only]] that [[time]], but that [[was]] enough. A few weeks [[into]] our first term of university, [[Tara]] and I [[met]] at the [[Starbucks]] near our [[old]] [[high]] [[school]]. She spoke first: “Mom and Dad support [[us]].”

“Same for my [[parents]].”

“So I wasn’t the only [[one]] who blabbed.” We [[kissed]], and made plans to go to [[city]] hall tomorrow. When tomorrow [[came]], we sat in a park, stunned by a sudden development.

I tried to be hopeful: “We can’t be sure, [[til]] we see a [[doctor]].”

“Don’t, Gale. We [[lost]] it. It’s all over, before it all began.” Her [[crying]] [[face]] [[burrowed]] in my [[chest]]. All I could do was [[pet]] her hair, [[stroke]] her back, and [[look]] at the grey sky.
