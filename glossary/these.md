[[After]] we steered down a lush forest path, the GPS stopped working. I had no idea where we were, but the driver knew the way by heart. He had [[seen]] the forest many more times than me, having visited twice a [[year]] with his father. Back then, he was a nervous graduate student while I was [[still]] a child. How could I have known that he would [[become]] [[such]] an important colleague and mentor in the [[years]] to [[come]]? We had both grown up so much [[since]] those days.
