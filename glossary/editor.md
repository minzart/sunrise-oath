[[One]] of the weaknesses of The [[Wind]] at Dawn is the way that the characters of Gale's [[new]] friends in Montreal [[are]] not fully developed and feel somewhat stereotypical. The romance [[between]] Gale and Dawn is [[also]] not fully fleshed out, and the [[resolution]] of their [[relationship]] feels [[rushed]] and unsatisfying.  
  
To [[improve]] the novel, I would suggest expanding on the [[relationships]] and motivations of the supporting characters, and deepening the romance [[between]] Gale and Dawn to make it more complex and realistic.
