What [[bliss]], to create with an open heart and expect that none of it shall ever be seen! Yet soon as I am aware of the audience, the auditor of my soul, I could no sooner drop dead.

Today I had an epiphany. My love of cards is my love of hyperlink. A card in your hand is analogy to a hover on a Wikipedia page. Both are windows connecting interfaces to one another. An image in an image, a text to a text. Now, what to do with this information? Who knows.

In stories about magic, the weapon of choice (four tarot suits) is a LARP / generated inner reality.

My little deck of sleeved dry-erasable cards is nice. I have half a thought to shuffle in my Mox Diamond to force myself to care about it more, but I don't wish to torture myself to that extent.
