Read a criticism of [[rhetoric]] against [[caffeine]]. I am tempted to [[have]] a [[coffee]]. Instead, enjoying [[my]] [[nicotine]] vape.

# Tomb of the [[Blind]] Dragon 

*For [[many]] years the tomb of the [[Blind]] Dragon was considered lost. These days it [[is]] infested by cats, which don't care about the past of the [[place]]. It [[is]] rumored that the tomb [[is]] rich [[with]] magical artifacts.*

1. To rooms 144 and 128 of the dungeon.
2. An altar of weapons, each [[one]] cursed to misfortune.
3. A [[shy]] bard, examining an uncanny, sticky to touch horn. Unaware of the key hidden in a crack in the wall.
4. A lavishly decorated gate on the [[western]] wall of the chamber.
5. Sealed away from the world, a heavy [[presence]] looms.
6. A cat that warns of what [[is]] [[ahead]].
7. The bones of the dragon, and a sarcophagus of his [[human]] [[companion]]. His [[spirit]] persists.
8. A corpse of a pirate, a breastplate and an exotic halberd nearby.
9. Detailed instructions for the architect of Himero to hide the dragon's bones, and unite him [[with]] the late hero.
10. A medium sarcophagus for an architect, [[with]] an unknown dried potion.
