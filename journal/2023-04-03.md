>Let your creative side out to play, Capricorn! Expressive Mercury zips into Taurus and your flamboyant fifth house until June 11, encouraging you to live—and [[speak]]—[[with]] passion. [[Even]] if it feels out of character for your reserved sign, let your mic-dropping commentaries get everyone [[thinking]] [[outside]] the box. This Mercury cycle can embolden your romantic pitches, so take the lead [[with]] some vigorous right-swiping. But [[remember]] to back up your words [[with]] action so you don't get dubbed a player—especially while Mercury spins into retrograde from April 21 to May 14.

Took the carpet out of [[my]] room and moved it to the common room that [[my]] brother and I [[have]] been procrastinating on. Long [[time]] coming, for sure. [[There]] was so much dust under, I could [[have]] eaten a bowl of it as cereal.

11:12am. Blessings to the world. I took away the stool/bench I [[have]] been using at [[my]] computer, and am mad I did it not sooner. It has likely costed [[me]] years of [[my]] health and sanity, and at last it [[is]] now [[gone]].

It taught [[me]] a lesson: cursed objects exist. Only the ones that may be controlled [[shall]] be [[left]] to stand. [[They]] [[shall]] [[never]] be allowed to take [[body]] or mind as their domain.
