Took the carpet out of my room and moved it to the common room that my brother and I have been procrastinating on. Long time coming, for sure. There was so much dust under, I could have eaten a bowl of it as cereal.

11:12am. Blessings to the world. I took away the stool/bench I have been using at my computer, and am mad I did it not sooner. It has likely costed me years of my health and sanity, and at last it is now gone.

It taught me a lesson: cursed objects exist. Only the ones that may be controlled shall be left to stand. They shall never be allowed to take body or mind as their domain.
