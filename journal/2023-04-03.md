>Let [[your]] [[creative]] side out [[to]] play, [[Capricorn]]! Expressive Mercury zips [[into]] Taurus and [[your]] flamboyant fifth [[house]] until June 11, encouraging [[you]] [[to]] live—and [[speak]]—[[with]] [[passion]]. [[Even]] [[if]] it [[feels]] out [[of]] character for [[your]] reserved sign, let [[your]] mic-dropping commentaries get everyone [[thinking]] [[outside]] [[the]] box. This Mercury cycle can embolden [[your]] romantic pitches, so take [[the]] lead [[with]] some vigorous [[right]]-swiping. But [[remember]] [[to]] [[back]] up [[your]] [[words]] [[with]] [[action]] so [[you]] don't get dubbed [[a]] [[player]]—especially while Mercury spins [[into]] retrograde [[from]] April 21 [[to]] [[May]] 14.

[[Long]] [[time]] [[coming]], for sure. [[There]] [[was]] so [[much]] dust [[under]], [[I]] [[could]] [[have]] eaten [[a]] bowl [[of]] it [[as]] cereal.
