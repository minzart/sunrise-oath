Yesterday was a creative day. Many ideas came readily. Yet I acted on but a few, and so the rest of [[my]] intellectual industry was left wasted. How many such [[days]] can a person expect in a lifetime? How many more are in store for me? Ten a year, in a good year (this year has been too kind to me), so if I were to be conservative and guess a mean of half that, I may have but two hundred or so strokes of genius before I get a real stroke and [[die]].

[[Today]] I bought 2500 basic lands for $25. This may as well be infinite.
