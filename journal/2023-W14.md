The only greater [[fear]] I [[have]] than that of [[being]] [[forgotten]] [[is]] that of [[being]] remembered. Yet both are true, the [[one]] and only [[truth]]!

[[My]] chamber, emptied of excess, performs the function I had [[first]] intended. A studio of the arts, of exploration, [[is]] mine. I may play on these [[pages]] any way I wish, and no [[one]] may criticize [[me]] til the faraway future when its contents are cracked open for [[someone]] to see.

That I can write and write, and [[never]] stop til the long eternal sleep, [[is]] the [[great]] freedom I craved for all these years. No [[one]] holds [[me]] back, save the critic resting on [[my]] shoulders. Damned head, be rid of hate and notion.
