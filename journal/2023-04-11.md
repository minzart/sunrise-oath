[[Azi]] the [[monk]] meets [[Lea]] and [[Primo]] in passing on his way back westward. He comes to [[Starhaven]] and seeks the source of the unicorn [[horn]]. Once the teacher of many, incl. [[larissa|Larissa]] the [[widow]] who was once his patron and first follower, he entered hermitage to reflect on his former failings. In the meantime, the widow spent her wealth on material, among them alabaster statues. He is joined by [[zephyr|Zephyr]] Pirates, an airborne hanggliding gang of outcasts from an island. The wish of these outlaws is to gather men and power to rebel against their old clan. Their leader is a disgraced [[vampire]] who, though struggling to fly, lends her power in the arm of dueling in exchange for their devotion.

A feline soldier opposes them, trying to capture the criminals and their ascetic ally. His skill [[with]] the bola forces them to stay on the run.

[[With]] the pirates, he embarks on a collective journey to an ancient tree. Taking shelter in a dungeon after seeing approaching adventurers, the others disperse upon hearing [[Boxes]] screaming in a frenzy. The monk meets the adventurers, incl. [[Corrin]] in sneevil form, [[Donne]] in bear form, [[Boxes]] in human form, and an injured [[Aldous]] who suspects him. He helps to diffuse the situation, and they exit the dungeon together.

The next day, they visit the [[elf]] that caused the [[body]] switching. The switch between [[Corrin]] and [[Boxes]] is reversed, but [[Donne]] is stuck in his bear form. Setting out the next day toward the tree, [[Donne]] leaves [[with]] the mother bear to find his old [[body]]. He entrusts [[Aldous]] to stay [[with]] [[Corrin]] and protect their master, and to keep an eye on the [[monk]] [[Azi]]. 

Heading north, they arrive in [[gem|Gem]] City. There, while [[Azi]] meditates and [[Aldous]] recuperates from his injuries, [[Corrin]] wanders the city for clean vestments and accidentally encounters the [[widow]], though she claims to be seeing her husband soon. In reality, she was going to make an offering to him at home, leading up to a journey to his demonic mausoleum. Before parting ways, she tells the knight to kill a monk if he ever encounters one.

Back at the inn, [[Corrin]] relays the information that [[Larissa]] hates him and is married.

The monk gains insight and enters the spirit realm at sundown. The collective experience has those around him directing him, aiding him [[with]] apparations they create. When he emerges, the vision has become reality; all former allies in the dream become foes. Angels come to aid in a fight against evil.

The widow intervenes, and is corrupted by the demon of dust. She turns to darkness, eschewing the lessons of her former master and secret love. She leads an army of alabaster golems.
