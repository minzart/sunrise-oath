[[Azi]] the [[monk]] meets [[Lea]] and [[Primo]] in passing on his way back westward. He comes to [[Starhaven]] and seeks the source of the unicorn [[horn]]. Once the teacher of many, incl. [[larissa|Larissa]] the [[widow]] who was once his patron and first follower, he entered hermitage to reflect on his former failings. In the meantime, the widow spent her wealth on material, among them alabaster statues. He [[is]] joined by [[zephyr|Zephyr]] [[Pirates]], an airborne hanggliding gang of outcasts from an island. The wish of these outlaws [[is]] to gather men and power to rebel against their old clan. Their leader [[is]] a disgraced [[vampire]] who, though struggling to fly, lends her power in the arm of dueling in exchange for their devotion.
