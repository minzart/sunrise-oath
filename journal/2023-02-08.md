Almost dinner as I [[write]] these [[words]], [[and]] wanted simply somewhere to [[be]] [[heard]]. I [[leave]] a mark for [[someone]] [[else]] to [[read]], [[and]] [[wish]] that [[they]] [[may]] see [[me]] as I was.

Days [[later]], I [[return]] [[and]] see [[old]] convictions. 2:31am, [[and]] Alex awaits [[me]] [[come]] the morn. To sleep, or not to sleep?
