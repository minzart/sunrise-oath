- [ ] Complete Sunrise Oath Issue 4
- [ ] [[Port]] notes from Google [[Keep]]

Hildegard's divine warrant to write appeals to [[me]]. Though I [[have]] no illusion of matching her in her triumphs, [[may]] I [[learn]] from her example. She [[was]] a [[woman]] of [[God]], a [[small]] miracle in the [[body]] of a terranean primate.

To [[whom]] [[do]] I write, and for what? [[Futility]], and vanity, and pride. That was [[my]] master, til I knew the [[truth]]. For all [[my]] life I lived a lie, and lies are all I gained from sinful life. I [[found]] the [[truth]] by the [[light]] of the sunrise, led to God by his angels. 

Goddesses—[[Athena]], [[Hera]], [[Aphrodite]]—I [[shall]] not [[speak]] to you in prayer, as I [[must]] [[keep]] a [[proper]] oath to [[Jesus]]. But I [[shall]] [[keep]] you in [[my]] reveries, as guardians of the [[faith]] that I was gifted. The [[wind]] [[is]] [[mind]], and [[mind]] [[is]] [[God]].
