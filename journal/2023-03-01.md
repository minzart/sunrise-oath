JOSHUA. Father. You summon me.

JOSEPH. Stand up straight. Sit.

JOSHUA. [[Shall]] I stand, or [[shall]] I sit?

JOSEPH. Your mother died this morning.

JOSHUA. Lies.

JOSEPH. [[My]] son.

JOSHUA. No. Dare you not say more.

JOSEPH. I fear [[there]] [[is]] more for me to dare to say.

JOSHUA. Please.

JOSEPH. Her life was taken by this very hand.


JOSEPH. Never was I a savior, but I am not a killer.

JOSHUA. Blood on your hand. Death to your soul.

JOSEPH.
