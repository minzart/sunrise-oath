I [[wonder]] what I meant on [[2023-04-02]].

[[Saw]] Rennie [[today]] at the plaza near University of [[Waterloo]]. Her exam went [[well]], I heard. [[We]] had Korean food and talked about recent interests, the weather, [[our]] families, [[culture]], [[politics]], and lifestyle. She [[is]] [[doing]] [[well]]. I often think that [[my]] [[future]] kids would love her as a family friend. That drives [[me]] to be a [[better]] friend.

[[We]] played [[my]] [[game]], starting from [[Starhaven]] with a rabbit [[named]] [[Fluffy]] who goes to [[The]] [[Horn]] in search of [[hay]] [[beer]]. While [[there]], a [[kind]], playful, and powerful tinkerer [[named]] [[Vera]] casts [[an]] enslavement charm and acquires her as a [[slave]]. [[Vera]] [[later]] dies in the woods [[outside]] the [[Dungeon]] of [[Himero]], leaving [[Fluffy]] free but [[alone]].
