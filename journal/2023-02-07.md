Montreal, 1999. *South of the border, west of the sun (apologies to Muraharu), was where the dawn was [[found]]. No noble soul may [[keep]] the lie [[an]] art. 

A writer in the morning at the Old [[Port]] of Montreal. Under the [[moon]] [[broke]] the sunrise [[oath]].

At [[night]], rain. It [[stops]], and [[Gale]] [[Jones]] leaves his un et demi to [[Alexandra]] Basin, where [[seven]] years ago [[he]] saw her. [[There]] [[she]] stands, as [[she]] was.

**[[STRANGER]]. A [[good]] [[time]] and [[place]] for a walk.**

**[[GALE]]. Say. [[Have]] [[we]] met?**

**[[STRANGER]]. I wouldn’t [[know]].**

**[[GALE]]. How could you not [[know]]?**

**[[STRANGER]]. It’s in the past, and lost to [[me]] forever.**

**[[GALE]]. [[Amnesia]]?**

**[[STRANGER]]. It must be. Yes, [[amnesia]]!**

The writer knows not the words, not yet. Nothing but [[regret]] for dashed hopes.

**[[STRANGER]]. I [[ask]], dear [[stranger]]. Do you love the sunrise?**

**[[GALE]]. Nothing to love about the sunrise.**

**[[STRANGER]]. I see. Do you mind waiting?**

[[They]] watch the sunrise for two minutes. *Two minutes, a small degree of sky at daybreak. Full, perfect seconds stay and go—[[one]] and [[another]], forever hanging—seeking the splendid authority of the day's new [[light]].*

**[[GALE]]. True, that you [[know]] [[me]] not?**
