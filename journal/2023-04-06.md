I always had the idea to make a wiki map that I can explore at my leisure, and now is when I shall finally do it. Keeping it simple with Cartesian coordinates is what it takes. Tried a hex version and immediately made a mess of things. Execution is hard.

I need to map my [[campaign]] to locations on the map. Or maybe I can keep the two separate. Yeah, let’s do that.

At the [[origin]], everything begins. A unit is a kilometer, at least til I get tired of tracking this. (This means buildings shall, for the most part, be contained on one tile.)
