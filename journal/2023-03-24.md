For no reason [[other]] than vanity, the [[word]] of the day [[is]] [[metempsychosis]]. (Note, I knew not what this [[word]] [[even]] meant til I [[thought]] to make it [[my]] [[brief]] passing focus.)

I [[feel]] some level of stress about [[having]] to complete the tasks I listed above. For some reason, it pressures [[me]] to [[have]] [[my]] desires [[written]] [[out]] as [[if]] I [[have]] [[been]] [[figured]] out. [[Maybe]] [[there]] [[is]] a desire to [[never]] be known, not [[even]] by [[myself]].

I [[found]] [[my]] wet erase markers from Amazon in the melted snow beside the front porch, caked in mud. I bought [[them]] last month and [[only]] [[thought]] this [[morning]] to check [[whether]] [[they]] would ever arrive. (I almost [[even]] ordered [[new]] ones, [[having]] [[forgotten]] of the original [[order]].)
