For no reason [[other]] [[than]] vanity, the [[word]] of the [[day]] [[is]] [[metempsychosis]]. ([[Note]], I knew not [[what]] this [[word]] [[even]] meant til I [[thought]] to make it [[my]] [[brief]] passing focus.)

I [[feel]] some [[level]] of stress about [[having]] to complete tasks. For some reason, it pressures [[me]] to [[have]] [[my]] desires [[written]] [[out]] as [[if]] I [[have]] [[been]] [[figured]] out. [[Maybe]] [[there]] [[is]] a [[desire]] to [[never]] be known, not [[even]] by [[myself]].

I [[found]] [[my]] wet erase markers from Amazon in the melted snow beside the front porch, caked in mud. I bought [[them]] last [[month]] and [[only]] [[thought]] this [[morning]] to check [[whether]] [[they]] would [[ever]] arrive. (I almost [[even]] ordered [[new]] ones, [[having]] [[forgotten]] of the original [[order]].)
