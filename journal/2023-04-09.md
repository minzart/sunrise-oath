*Hold my hand and lull me to sleep in fragile peace
Sing a lullaby to comfort me*

*Promise me that you will die when I leave
Promise me that you will too, after you weep*
*As your [[liege]], I give a final plea*

*I was once the Queen of Clemency*
*A paragon of holy grace*
*A ruler of virtue*

*But my fear of becoming forgotten by time*
*Imbued the Devil in my decree*

*Make rubble all that I reigned*
*May burned to ash my loyal subjects be*
*To nothing falls my domain*
