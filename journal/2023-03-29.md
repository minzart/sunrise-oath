Procrastinated in the most productive way [[possible]]. [[Released]] two [[games]] in two days.

The [[first]] [[is]] [[a]] [[solo]] [[journal]] [[deck]] [[system]]. [[Open]]-[[ended]] [[solo]] RPG, or [[guided]] journaling. The [[second]] [[is]] a port of a [[game]] I [[have]] not [[released]] yet which [[is]] [[an]] abstraction of [[Genesis]]: Battle of Champions. [[Imagine]]: a grid-based [[card]] [[game]] where [[players]] can all make their own cards, and the constraints + inherent tradeoffs make it impossible to indefinitely [[powercreep]].
