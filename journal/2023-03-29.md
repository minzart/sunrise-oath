Procrastinated in the most productive way possible. Released two games in two days.

[Tower of Babel](https://sunriseoath.itch.io/tower-of-babel "https://sunriseoath.itch.io/tower-of-babel") 

[a simple combat system. (1666)](https://sunriseoath.itch.io/1666 "https://sunriseoath.itch.io/1666") 

The first is a solo journal deck system. Open-ended solo RPG, or guided journaling. The second is a port of a game I have not released yet which is an abstraction of Genesis: Battle of Champions. Imagine: a grid-based card game where players can all make their own cards, and the constraints + inherent tradeoffs make it impossible to indefinitely powercreep.
