[[A]] [[cold]] [[day]]. Plans fell [[through]], [[one]] by [[one]]. Alexei and [[Daniel]] [[are]] at the [[new]] Phyrexia (confuse not [[with]] the *[[New]] Phyrexia*) prerelease, as [[they]] [[could]] not buy [[a]] [[pack]] to take [[away]], and [[so]] the 1pm hangout was canceled. [[Justin]] and I went back and [[forth]] on going to [[a]] prerelease [[together]], and [[ultimately]] decided to [[stay]] in.

[[My]] [[piano]] [[journal]] was [[a]] [[flop]], perhaps as [[expected]] but not [[without]] [[much]] sadness and ire from [[me]]. Sometimes I [[wonder]] [[what]] I [[have]] that the world wants. [[True]] believers [[came]] easier before [[than]] [[now]]. [[What]] [[should]] I mark as [[my]] destiny? [[How]] [[shall]] I [[move]] as fate progresses [[forth]]?

As for [[me]], this [[is]] [[a]] [[good]] [[day]] to continue the [[port]] of all [[my]] [[other]] [[writing]] to here. [[Something]] feels [[different]] [[when]] I type in here, truly. [[Good]] interfaces [[make]] [[a]] huge difference, apparently. I might [[even]] [[go]] as [[far]] as to [[move]] some [[things]] from Google Docs here, though that [[may]] [[be]] unwise in the horrific [[case]] [[where]] everything gets deleted in some sort of freak accident. It would truly [[be]] the [[digital]] equivalent of brain trauma.
