I walk [[through]] [[an]] overgrown schoolyard, [[where]] all [[my]] [[dreams]] and misadventures lead [[me]]. A portable classroom, covered in vines, [[is]] a [[shrine]] in the [[forgotten]] [[corner]] of the campus. Who [[else]] [[comes]] here at this hour? [[Only]] [[me]]. I sit on the wooden steps, and [[remember]] [[when]] I was [[there]] [[with]] [[another]]. I [[wonder]] [[how]] [[she]] [[is]] [[doing]], that maiden of the [[sun]] and the [[sea]].

I [[have]] a bag of [[dice]]. [[They]] [[help]] [[me]] on [[my]] journey, giving [[me]] [[something]] to cling to. Sometimes, making choices [[is]] too [[much]] to bear. I [[shall]] [[leave]] the [[verdict]], the voice of [[truth]], [[up]] to fate.
