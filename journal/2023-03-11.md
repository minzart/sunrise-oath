I walk through [[an]] overgrown schoolyard, where all [[my]] dreams and misadventures lead me. A portable classroom, covered in vines, is a shrine in the forgotten corner of the campus. Who else comes here at this hour? Only me. I sit on the wooden steps, and remember when I was there [[with]] another. I wonder how she is doing, that maiden of the sun and the [[sea]].

I have a bag of dice. They help me on [[my]] journey, giving me something to cling to. Sometimes, making choices is too much to bear. I shall leave the verdict, the voice of truth, up to fate.

Heads, I go to heaven. Tails, I go to hell.

*Tails.* To hell we go.

I find a tear in the fabric of reality, and tug at the seams to let myself through, tunneling through to a deep abyss. Far from the current moment, the flames are as they are and take the form of the dragons and demons I know only from memory. The great burden of the past weighs on me, but not as it used to. No one should have to carry their own corpse.

A voice calls to me. [[Athena]], Hera, or Aphrodite?

*Aphrodite.* The most neglected of them! There she sits across from me at Génoise, crying a single tear, having her coffee and smiling through the bitterness. “Always so selfish,” she says, less accusing me than jotting down a diagnosis. “Have you considered how much I wanted you to be happy?”

I saw her struggle, and it confused me. Was I worthy of love, of beauty? Why would anyone, let alone [[an]] angel, sacrifice themselves for me? Something like that belonged in fairy tales, not in whatever world I made [[my]] [[home]]. Standing from the table, I say: “Let’s get some fresh air.”

The Old [[Port]], the [[café]] at Laurier, or Pin Up?

*Laurier.* When was the last [[time]] we were there? She looks around, and smiles. «Maintenant, je me souviens. Elle aussi, Louise était ici.»

«Tu te souviens.»

«Et alors, pourquoi prend-toi ce chance à t'en jetter dans le piscine? Sais-tu que je veux te noyer?» Elle rit, mais ses yeux sont sérieux. «C’est pas assez de dire la verité. Il faut que tu soit vrai, vraiment vraiment. Tu sais ce que je te dis?»

“I understand.” Something felt wrong about answering her, but what else was I to do? I was sad, and knew not why, not completely. There was [[an]] emptiness I looked past in myself for too long. I told myself it was anxiety or malaise, but it is something deeper. It is the hole that so many others speak of, the void that becomes [[my]] God if I am not careful. I see myself, and cease to exist. I hear myself, and become less a man than a voice, a whisper in a world without fairies, a scent of strawberry and vanilla in the wind at dawn.

Disappearing from the place where I last saw the soprano from Lyon, I am at the barricade, the one and only barricade. Sitting on the bench is not the stranger [[with]] the light blue dress, the one I speak of as a trope enigma, but her, the muse I cannot bear to show the world. “Why now?” she asked, tugging at a pigtail. “I thought you didn’t need me anymore.”

“I don’t.” I rest next to her, [[my]] legs sore and tingling. “I miss you. Is that reason enough?”

“Then live [[with]] me.” She pleads. “Say the magic word.”

“You always do that,” I say plainly. “Quote me, copy me, mock me.”

She shakes her head. “Never mockery. You are the person I admire most in the whole wide world.”

“You have no reason to.”

“You lost sight,” she said. “There once was a younger man, [[an]] older boy, who found me. Where is he now? Can he be by [[my]] side again?”

Her head rests on [[my]] shoulder, and there I let it stay. Tracing the hole in [[my]] chest, her finger shows me where the pain resides—right where [[my]] lungs are.

“Breathe.” She said it again, commanding a second [[time]]: “Breathe.”

I float up from the bench, [[with]] her in [[my]] arms. We fly across the surface of the water (the face of the deep) and see the magical paradise I created from [[my]] imagination. Together, we built Jerusalem. Yet I cast her from the capital we founded, and never forgave myself.

“Drop me in the water.” Her voice no longer orders me; rather, she begs. “Let me feel how wet it is.”

I hesitate. “Can I see you again?”

“Whenever you want,” she says. “This is all in your mind, in the end.”

I let her fall. Her [[body]] crashes into the water, and where she sinks in becomes the center of a mighty vortex that sucks everything into it. In the void, outside of the [[time]] and space that these words ordain, I stand and wonder where I should go next.

Heads, persist. Tails, resist.

*Persist.* Honestly I ran out of things to write about, but I should keep going. None of this writing is that useful, but there's something magical about letting [[my]] thoughts flow. No point kidding myself that I will use this, but who knows. At the very least, it is training data for AI Tim. That is a serious application.

Anyway, [[time]] for some more solo [[journal]] work.

>Her red hair was a curse, a bloodline stain. Or so she thought on days when she was all alone, without a knight to save her from [[adventure]] and take her back to the home she misses so.
>
>A blue gown, one that flowed and billowed more than she liked, was the duty that her father placed upon her, to uphold the honor of their [[time]]-old name. Her bare feet, aching from the gravel path, are all that keep her in the present [[time]], for if her mind slips she shall fall to sleep.

>“Give in,” the sword said, tempting her. “Wield me, and unleash [[my]] power.”

>She entered the ruins, continuing to keep her arm at her side, using it as a maestro's wand-baton.

That's all for today. Good night.
