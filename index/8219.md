The woman peered from under her hood, revealing eyes of different colors. She asked me, “Why have you not crossed this river?”  
  
I offered my hand, saying nothing. Taking her to the opposite bank, carrying her on my shoulder, the weight of her [[body]] gave me purpose.  
  
At our destination, she frowned and looked at my feet. “Your left shoe.”  
  
It was gone. My bare foot was wet with the waters of the strange planet. “Sorry,” I said, though there was no reason to be.  
  
“Here.” She took off her robe, showing herself as an angel of marriage. “Dry yourself, and keep me close to your side.”  
  
I put on the robe. As I tried to thank her, she was gone.  
  
The angel was in the water, swimming and laughing. “I am free.”  
  
I took a step forward, dipping an exposed foot back in the river. Once more, it was wet.  
  
“You best be on your way,” she said, smiling. “I have nothing else for you, not til the heavens grant our next meeting.”  
  
She was wrong. Standing there and watching her wade through the current, I took for myself the sight of her glistening shoulder, the sound of her overflowing joy, the knowledge of her irresistible [[grace]].
